0,Arijit,Nice buy,4,23-Jan-19,"Decent taste. Certainly original as I have verified it through their sms service. Only downside is mixing is really tough. I use a mixer and it still doesn't mix properly! Also doesn't mix well in hot milk. Never tried mixing using a shaker though. Also, I did a lot of calculations. This supplement offers one of the best protein/rupee ratio, much better than muscleblaze gold or massgainer pro and the likes. Of course, there is a limit to serving size so you can get only 12 g of protein at once. What I'm trying to say here is that it's cost-effective and bang for your buck",
1,Umang,MB is nice but Bad shipping,5,16-Oct-18,Get this 💰 999Seems to be nice. As I heard about MB it is a genuine product that's why I buy this.Can give the review after use.But jar was broken when I get this.Amazing part is amazon refund it. Due to broken jar. Thanks,
2,Arun Vashist,Good protein for regular use and gym beginners,4,3-Jan-19,"For beginners it's a great option to start with, it has around 12% protein, digestive enzymes for easy absorption of protein and no sugar.Taste is a personal choice but I have found the chocolate flavour really tasty.Mixing it with water and milk is not really effortless, but not that bad.",
3,Prashant_PJ,Very Effective And Genuine Product.,5,22-May-18,Muscle blaze has always been a trusted brand for fitness  So I decided to order this Supplement..But I was doubt that I would get the original product or not..When the product was received it was completely original.. A code is given inside its lid. That code can be detected by messaging.,
4,Amazon Customer,Cheaters,1,28-Jan-19,"The quantity of the powder I wonder if it’s even 750mg , forget about 1 kg , as you can see the picture the box is more than half empty as I open it. No wonder it was so cheap , I don’t know if this product is even genuine. Why cheat us ? When you can’t deliver quality products.",
5,ST,Low quality protein,2,4-May-19,The protein content is too low and this product causes bloating. The base of the container looked as though someone tried to cut it open and empty the content,
6,Parichay,It's a SCAM,1,19-Jan-19,1. In one serving you get only 12 g protein which is disgusting and 12 g of carbohydrates which should not be there in whey protein.2. Bottom seal is broken in most of the packs and item isn't returnable too. That's sad3. At same price go for some protein which has 20-24 g of protein per scoop and low carbohydratesVERY BAD DEAL IN ALL,
7,Bharat Singh,A brief Review of Beginner Protein.,3,17-Jan-19,"Product is good. However, those having indigestion issues shouldn't buy this. As, it contains artificial sweeteners as well as high quantity of Carbohydrates which don't digest quickly will leave you in lurch and will cause flatuation and bloating all around the day. I would recommend go for high protein content with no artificial sweeteners and low carbs. Any product of muscleblaze shows result with consistent hard work accompanied with good diet and rest(min 6-7 hours a day).I also recommend you to drink water as much as possible at least 4 litres a day while on protein intake. Drink protein powder in water not in milk. Milk contains caesin protein which is useful at night before bed. If Caesin mix whey protein l, it will take a lot of time to digest and again bloating and flatualence.Best time of protein shake- Anabolic State and/or Between the meals.All the best friends!",
8,srikara,Great for beginners,5,14-Oct-18,"I used this product for a month, this was my first protein supplement, before buying this I was really nervous but now I've seen significant amount of muscle gain and u can see muscle growth in 2 weeks for use real confidence booster for beginner great product by muscle blaze hope beginners will find this helpful😉😉😄",
9,Nitin,Make a proper Research before buying this,3,23-Mar-21,"Hi All, I am writing this review after using 1 box of this beginner's protein. certainly it will help you with your supplement requirements. BUT you need to research a little not for this product but yourself. just check your skin, if it is acne prone, don't buy it. It causes severe acne breakout. soon after taking this protein, I faced acne breakout on my face and back and on places where i never saw a pimple before. You can study online about this and choose a right brand and not this just because a shaker is free with it. thats what I did. I moved on to Myprotein. Although it is a bit expensive than this but I moved on from this product. I will write a review regarding my protein also after using it for a significant time.",

13,Aditya Saurav,Good purchase!,4,11-Jul-20,"Well I started working out few months ago and it was a helluva journey. A cousin of mine who's a fitness freak 😂 recommended me this. I got it fairly quick even in lockdown thanks to Amazon delivery service. I'd say it fulfilled its purpose. Since its a beginner product, it'll give you 12g of protein in one heaping scoop which is fairly enough for a beginner. It'll never miraculously help you in shedding weight as the product never intended to, its main purpose is to provide you protein which can be easily aborbed by your body after your workout session so that your muscles can heal up. Long story short its a good product to kickstart your healthly lifestyle. I've used it and I'm happy with it.",
14,Dhruv tiwari,This is real or fake product..,4,8-Oct-18,What is this to the back side of jar..is this fake item?,
15,ShEkhR_ShROff,Good,5,2-Nov-20,This whey protein is good and flavor is amazing. So tasty i will use 25g/day (15x2) morning 7:20 and evening 19:00You can buy this product,
16,Amazon Customer,Dont buy,1,24-Nov-18,Extremely poor quality and half filled box.Complete waste of money,
17,Ajith,Problem with shaker,4,13-Oct-20,"The product is good but the shaker is not air tight and while shaking with liquid (milk or water) inside some drops comes out of the edges of the side cap and the top sipper is air tight, no problem with the sipper part. Please modify the cap as airtight. btw the quality of plastic used in the shaker is awesome though. Thanks.",
18,MOSES MARK RAI,Good,4,29-Sep-19,So why is this protein very cheap as compared to other protein powders here is your answer yes the protein is cheap as it has lesser amount of protein % per scoop which is about 12g and plus 12g for carbohydrates as well comes with it other when protein has higher prices as they come with whipping amount of 26-30g of protein with 3.1g of carbohydrates...Now should we buy it is it worth it yes it is two scoops can give you 24g of protein and 24g of carbohydrates now now before you think isnt carbohydrates also there yes ut is but you can later reduce the carbohydrate intake from your diet to balance the calories.Now for the mixing it mixes well but only one scoop in 200ml water it doesn't have that heavy texture but 2 scoop will give you the perfect texturePricing yes 998 33servings it's a good dealLastly you cant label a protein powder good or bad just because you used it once at least 5-6 months you gotta use it in order to see the difference . And Getting a Good physique just doesnt come by consuming heavy expensive whey protein it takes time heavy lifting balanced diet and along with protein powder combination of all these can lead you to your fitness goal .I hope my review helps you in your fitness journey good luck,
19,Mahesh,not sure its genuine or not,1,16-Jan-19,i dont know its original product or not but its not good for health i become sick after taking it,
20,Salami,Useless pouch,1,28-Jan-22,"They've changed giving it from the box to the pouch, first every time its cumbersome to open and close the zip lock of this pouch.  And the second worst thing is the whole powder comes up flying in air once you open them due to pressure release as this is dry powder.  I don't understand how come a company could ruin a product for a customer just by spoiling the convenience of using it. Very disappointed and pathetic.",
21,Bisheswar Karmakar,Packs a punch,5,15-Jun-22,"This is the absolute best product you can find in this category. Perfect for muscle growth and keeping carbs and fat to a bare minimum. The protein content is almost double compared to other products, and what matters even more is the carb content which is extremely low.I'd say a 8/10 product, 2 points off for its poor solubility in both water and milk. Forms clumps and then I'd have to chomp on it separately.",
22,Shahjad Khan,Good one for beginners,3,22-Aug-19,Not a nice product overallBut it’s a suitable product for the beginners.,
23,Dhiraj Karne,Flavor is good and best for beginners who don't know what is protein and why take it so go for it,4,6-Jan-21,"First think this is not Muscle builder,fat loss product, weight gainer. This is only protein and this protein is good for beginners. Let's talk about flavor flavour is pawder chocolate i tried it with water and also milk in water i don't like it but when I try with milk this iss too good like chocolate milk shake i drink it daily. This protein 1 kg upto 50 to 60 days I takr 1 scoop daily with milk. I forgot about shaker so shakers material quality is good in shaker mixer the protein properly mix with milk or water",
24,Dillen,"Good, but not good:)",3,28-Dec-19,"It is all good, but better start consuming whey protein from start itself. If you read the protein content of this product, it us just 12 gms per serving, which quite less. Instead of this better go for Whey protein performance or Whey protein energy. And always go for flavour ones, because the unflavored ones are not easy to consume, you'll feel like you're on medication. So go for a product that is high in protein content, and which is flavoured. Thanks!",
25,DDas,I liked d product,4,13-Nov-18,Good product and received well packed from Amazon. I liked d product helps to boost strength spclly when u r tired from heavy workout. Tastes very good chocolatey. Thick and rich taste in milk or warm water. I consume once a day only after work out..so 5 days a week. It's my 1st experience with protein powder.,
26,Prakash Pathak,Don't buy received only half kg product tampered from bottom.,1,12-Sep-20,"Received tampered product , looks like someone has taken almost 300-400 grams of powder from bottom.I checked the code it was authentic product from muscle blaze but the jar was tempered from bottom. When I open the jar it was only half fill. I thought that would be the quantity as I was buying for the first time but yesterday when I refill the jar with asitis whey I realised that someone has taken around 30-400 grams out and repack the jar from bottom.Even it was purchased from the reputed seller it's a altered.Amazon should look into these kind of issue. 1st time users can be cheated easily by sellers.",
27,Mohammed Haisham Harees,Absolutely recommend it,4,24-Aug-21,"At first, I was a bit skeptical about buying this protein powder because of a lot claims from people who have used it here in the review section. I saw people complaining about how they developed certain skin problems and allergies. But I decided to buy it anyways and try it for myself and I am glad that I did.I gained close to 4kg last time I checked my weight. I am seeing a noticeable difference in my muscle growth. And no, I didn't experience any sort of side effects or whatever. But you have to know that, protein powder can cause certain side effects to some people (I have read MB's blog). But the only way to know it is by trying it for yourself.The flavour is rich and it tastes sort of creamy. Gonna order another bottles soon. Totally recommended. 😊",
28,Madhavendra Singh,Received damaged container,1,25 April 2021,"The seal was broken and had a hole in it and the taste was unusual prolly spoiled or contaminated had to throw it away. It was my first time buying supplements online and even when many people asked me to not buy it online even my fitness trainer even then I did, but Thanks to Amazon I received a full refund but it was still a disappointment to receive damage product after waiting for 5 days after placing the orderSo I'd recommend buy these things offline if you want to maintain a strict workout regime without any disturbance in day to day schedule a few hundred bucks are still worth to spend if you want your body to stay fit.But I've used this product earlier for like a year now so I'd say it's good for beginners just maintain a strict diet and buy it offline to reduce unwanted stress Amazon isn't a good choice for buying consumable or edible goods I'm saying this from past experiences too.",
29,Ashok,Disappointed.,1,3-Mar-19,I got these product and I checked it was authentic but it was becoming soapy when I diluted it..I don't know what the hell I got .Although delivery was fast😂😂,
30,VIVEK KHULLAR,Quality issues worst product received from Amazon,1,9-Feb-21,Received a defect quality product from Amazon. Its stinking and unconsumed one. I have informed both amazon and muscle blaze about it. And the irony is that no one is showing zeal to take the  responsibility of there fault product. Poor service shown by amazon to its prime and certified buyer.,
31,Manish,"Contains Maltodextrin, Protein content is very less per scoop",3,22-Nov-20,"Pros1. The flavor is good.2. The packaging is good.3. Mixability is good.4. It is okay for a price of Rs. 999.5. Funnily, it is enough sweet that you can use it as a substitute for adding sugar (if you have a habit of eating sugary food) because of its ingredients.Cons1. It contains Maltodextrin which has a very high GI, google and you would understand more, it is not a recommended ingredient if you have diabetes.2. The protein quantity per scoop is very less, so it might not be recommended if you have a little more experience or even for fast muscle recovery.3. Not recommended if you need insulin spike in your body.4. Not recommended for intermediate gym people.My verdict - It was good for a start but I am not gonna buy it again.If you really want Muscleblaze protein, go with MB Fuel one+.For students like me- If it is cheap, it doesn't mean it will be as effective, add 200 more and you can get unflavoured whey protein of MB which has higher protein content.",
32,Preeti,Go for beginners,4,20-Jun-20,It's an excellent product to start with protein supplement...the flavour makes it palatable.if you wish to fullfill your daily basic protein requirement apart from food you consume...go for it and you will see the results.i was suffering from excessive hairloss..one of the basic reason is lack of enough protein... although I was having eggs regularly...the day I started consuming it..my hairfall has reduced to 60%.unlike other heavy duty protein supplement this will not harm your body if you skip your workout for the day,

34,Akshay S.,Ideal for Beginners,4,22-Feb-21,"Beginners WheyPros1. Price : You can’t complain on this, don’t even try.2. Solubility is good, decent I’d say. Mix it with water/milk and grind for a smooth shake.3. Storage : Comes in an airtight jar4. Validity : You could easily check through the code given over the lid.5. Would easily last a month for 1 heap full scoop per day, depending on the usage.6. Taste : Everyone relates to this word “Chocolate”. Not bad at all.7. Certainly the best option out there for beginners and those seeking a budget friendly deal.8. Ideal Protein Content : Around 12 gms of protein is the safest bait for any beginner. Not more, no less.Cons1. Could cause digestion problems to lactose intolerant individuals and those with any history of stomach issues.2. If you’re not working out regularly, bloating is a possibility.3. A bit on the sweeter side. I like sweet, you may not though. Try adding more water or milk as per your taste.Note : Add water first and then the powder for ideal mixing and to avoid lumps.",

It says 12g per serving. If you calculate 30g of the substance for one serving then 12/30 is only 40 percentage whey. There are other products that exactly specify this, for a good one is around 84% or 84g per 100g. There are similar priced ones that has upto 80%. This means that the other 40 percent consists of maltodextrin which is like a filler substance that does not have any nutritional value. Do not buy.",

472,Ayush,I bought it for my daily protein requirement,5,5-Dec-21,"Well I am not into hardcore gymming stuff, I bought this to full fill my daily protein requirement  as everyone knows how's the hostels/pg have food quality.This time I tried protine powder from the muscle blaze before this I used to consume protinex which was much more costing than this, so bought cookie and cream flavour and I was surprised that it actually tasted like cookie and cream.I consume this with milk not with water as you know I am not into muscle building just some cardio stuff, so I don't need that instant protine intake.Can't comment on the sugar thing, as it has been mentioned on the nutritional value stricker that zero sugar but it always tasted sweet. May that flavour thing made it taste sweet.Overall it's a nice product, you guys can give it a try.After this, I am gonna try one of among mango or chocolate.",499
473,Sun,Just use it !!! Better than before 🍶🥛,5,1-Jul-21,"Extremely tasty and high quality Muscle Blaze  Beginners whey protein . I have been using Muscle Blaze for 2 years , but this one tastes so much better. Please buy,  everyone. Not only fitness enthusiasts, other adults in your family will love it like they do regular drinks in the market .",423
474,praveen,Good taste,5,10-Jun-21,"Build quality of the shaker is nice and even though gives a wierd flavour at the beginning, overall a pleasant taste when taken with some chilled water or ice.Yet a beginner so no idea about the nutritional improvement due to this",422
475,Suman Suresh,Genuineness 100 percent,5,24 April 2021,"I brought this product trusting the genuineness of the brand. I read a lot of reviews claiming the protein content was low, it was specifically written that this supplement was for beginners. Muscleblaze has other supplements having higher protein content too. The delivery, product and service was exemplary and followed to the word specified. Highly recommended for beginners",422
476,Lokesh Surana,Perfect product for beginners,5,29-Nov-20,"Read the description in the product. Initial you use half the scoop for first five days, then one scoop per day and slowly increasing it to two scoop per day.They also have codes to identify whether your product is authentic or not.",421
477,Tamal Roy,Value for money,4,10-Jun-20,"Perfect for beginners, you can have this with milk or water, while doing your workout. This is perfectly value for money, and really gives you energy while working out. Flavour is really good, and the packaging is awesome. You also get a spoon with the big container which keeps the whey safe.You should remember that this is whey protein, so don't have this before workout.One spoon a day is enough, and at the beginning, half spoon is enough.In short, it is highly recommended for beginners. The protein quantity is 40% which is Perfect for beginners, but if you are a pro, go for whey raw protein of the same company MuscleBlaze",473
478,Pritam,Totally satisfying Supplement,5,21-Sep-18,"If you want to get some good muscle mass. Then try this. Super delicious. If you have never tried whey protein they try this beginner's protein because this contains protein as much as carbohydrates! Which will give you optimum performances! No side effects. (Unless you have problens with lactic products)!DON'T GO FOR OTHER WHEY PROTEIN WHICH HAS 24G+ OF PROTEIN IN 32G OF SERVING IF YOU ARE TRYING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME, BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DIGEST THOSE IN FIRST TRY. SO BETTER TRY THIS FIRST",242
479,Rahul R.,Fake Product...,1,11-Oct-18,"No even One Star...Very dissapointed with Amazon...Fake product I got stomach ache , loose motion and swealing in limps and cheeks after having this product..Their side effect started after 3 weeks...My condition is bad now..I refer to doctor. He told me to stop taking this product.If I continue.. My condition will become more worse...So All who want to purchase these Product.I will suggest you to take different product not this product..Thank You🙏😔😔",229
480,Arijit,Nice buy,4,23-Jan-19,"Decent taste. Certainly original as I have verified it through their sms service. Only downside is mixing is really tough. I use a mixer and it still doesn't mix properly! Also doesn't mix well in hot milk. Never tried mixing using a shaker though. Also, I did a lot of calculations. This supplement offers one of the best protein/rupee ratio, much better than muscleblaze gold or massgainer pro and the likes. Of course, there is a limit to serving size so you can get only 12 g of protein at once. What I'm trying to say here is that it's cost-effective and bang for your buck",483
481,Umang,MB is nice but Bad shipping,5,16-Oct-18,Get this 💰 999Seems to be nice. As I heard about MB it is a genuine product that's why I buy this.Can give the review after use.But jar was broken when I get this.Amazing part is amazon refund it. Due to broken jar. Thanks,245
482,Arun Vashist,Good protein for regular use and gym beginners,4,3-Jan-19,"For beginners it's a great option to start with, it has around 12% protein, digestive enzymes for easy absorption of protein and no sugar.Taste is a personal choice but I have found the chocolate flavour really tasty.Mixing it with water and milk is not really effortless, but not that bad.",473
483,Prashant_PJ,Very Effective And Genuine Product.,5,22-May-18,Muscle blaze has always been a trusted brand for fitness  So I decided to order this Supplement..But I was doubt that I would get the original product or not..When the product was received it was completely original.. A code is given inside its lid. That code can be detected by messaging.,476
484,Amazon Customer,Cheaters,1,28-Jan-19,"The quantity of the powder I wonder if it’s even 750mg , forget about 1 kg , as you can see the picture the box is more than half empty as I open it. No wonder it was so cheap , I don’t know if this product is even genuine. Why cheat us ? When you can’t deliver quality products.",91
485,ST,Low quality protein,2,4-May-19,The protein content is too low and this product causes bloating. The base of the container looked as though someone tried to cut it open and empty the content,81
486,Parichay,It's a SCAM,1,19-Jan-19,1. In one serving you get only 12 g protein which is disgusting and 12 g of carbohydrates which should not be there in whey protein.2. Bottom seal is broken in most of the packs and item isn't returnable too. That's sad3. At same price go for some protein which has 20-24 g of protein per scoop and low carbohydratesVERY BAD DEAL IN ALL,55
487,Bharat Singh,A brief Review of Beginner Protein.,3,17-Jan-19,"Product is good. However, those having indigestion issues shouldn't buy this. As, it contains artificial sweeteners as well as high quantity of Carbohydrates which don't digest quickly will leave you in lurch and will cause flatuation and bloating all around the day. I would recommend go for high protein content with no artificial sweeteners and low carbs. Any product of muscleblaze shows result with consistent hard work accompanied with good diet and rest(min 6-7 hours a day).I also recommend you to drink water as much as possible at least 4 litres a day while on protein intake. Drink protein powder in water not in milk. Milk contains caesin protein which is useful at night before bed. If Caesin mix whey protein l, it will take a lot of time to digest and again bloating and flatualence.Best time of protein shake- Anabolic State and/or Between the meals.All the best friends!",47
488,srikara,Great for beginners,5,14-Oct-18,"I used this product for a month, this was my first protein supplement, before buying this I was really nervous but now I've seen significant amount of muscle gain and u can see muscle growth in 2 weeks for use real confidence booster for beginner great product by muscle blaze hope beginners will find this helpful😉😉😄",104
489,Nitin,Make a proper Research before buying this,3,23-Mar-21,"Hi All, I am writing this review after using 1 box of this beginner's protein. certainly it will help you with your supplement requirements. BUT you need to research a little not for this product but yourself. just check your skin, if it is acne prone, don't buy it. It causes severe acne breakout. soon after taking this protein, I faced acne breakout on my face and back and on places where i never saw a pimple before. You can study online about this and choose a right brand and not this just because a shaker is free with it. thats what I did. I moved on to Myprotein. Although it is a bit expensive than this but I moved on from this product. I will write a review regarding my protein also after using it for a significant time.",22
490,Salami,Useless pouch,1,28-Jan-22,"They've changed giving it from the box to the pouch, first every time its cumbersome to open and close the zip lock of this pouch.  And the second worst thing is the whole powder comes up flying in air once you open them due to pressure release as this is dry powder.  I don't understand how come a company could ruin a product for a customer just by spoiling the convenience of using it. Very disappointed and pathetic.",2
491,Bisheswar Karmakar,Packs a punch,5,15-Jun-22,"This is the absolute best product you can find in this category. Perfect for muscle growth and keeping carbs and fat to a bare minimum. The protein content is almost double compared to other products, and what matters even more is the carb content which is extremely low.I'd say a 8/10 product, 2 points off for its poor solubility in both water and milk. Forms clumps and then I'd have to chomp on it separately.",1
492,Shahjad Khan,Good one for beginners,3,22-Aug-19,Not a nice product overallBut it’s a suitable product for the beginners.,11
493,Dhiraj Karne,Flavor is good and best for beginners who don't know what is protein and why take it so go for it,4,6-Jan-21,"First think this is not Muscle builder,fat loss product, weight gainer. This is only protein and this protein is good for beginners. Let's talk about flavor flavour is pawder chocolate i tried it with water and also milk in water i don't like it but when I try with milk this iss too good like chocolate milk shake i drink it daily. This protein 1 kg upto 50 to 60 days I takr 1 scoop daily with milk. I forgot about shaker so shakers material quality is good in shaker mixer the protein properly mix with milk or water",2
494,Dillen,"Good, but not good:)",3,28-Dec-19,"It is all good, but better start consuming whey protein from start itself. If you read the protein content of this product, it us just 12 gms per serving, which quite less. Instead of this better go for Whey protein performance or Whey protein energy. And always go for flavour ones, because the unflavored ones are not easy to consume, you'll feel like you're on medication. So go for a product that is high in protein content, and which is flavoured. Thanks!",6
495,DDas,I liked d product,4,13-Nov-18,Good product and received well packed from Amazon. I liked d product helps to boost strength spclly when u r tired from heavy workout. Tastes very good chocolatey. Thick and rich taste in milk or warm water. I consume once a day only after work out..so 5 days a week. It's my 1st experience with protein powder.,8
496,Prakash Pathak,Don't buy received only half kg product tampered from bottom.,1,12-Sep-20,"Received tampered product , looks like someone has taken almost 300-400 grams of powder from bottom.I checked the code it was authentic product from muscle blaze but the jar was tempered from bottom. When I open the jar it was only half fill. I thought that would be the quantity as I was buying for the first time but yesterday when I refill the jar with asitis whey I realised that someone has taken around 30-400 grams out and repack the jar from bottom.Even it was purchased from the reputed seller it's a altered.Amazon should look into these kind of issue. 1st time users can be cheated easily by sellers.",3
497,Mohammed Haisham Harees,Absolutely recommend it,4,24-Aug-21,"At first, I was a bit skeptical about buying this protein powder because of a lot claims from people who have used it here in the review section. I saw people complaining about how they developed certain skin problems and allergies. But I decided to buy it anyways and try it for myself and I am glad that I did.I gained close to 4kg last time I checked my weight. I am seeing a noticeable difference in my muscle growth. And no, I didn't experience any sort of side effects or whatever. But you have to know that, protein powder can cause certain side effects to some people (I have read MB's blog). But the only way to know it is by trying it for yourself.The flavour is rich and it tastes sort of creamy. Gonna order another bottles soon. Totally recommended. 😊",2
498,Madhavendra Singh,Received damaged container,1,25 April 2021,"The seal was broken and had a hole in it and the taste was unusual prolly spoiled or contaminated had to throw it away. It was my first time buying supplements online and even when many people asked me to not buy it online even my fitness trainer even then I did, but Thanks to Amazon I received a full refund but it was still a disappointment to receive damage product after waiting for 5 days after placing the orderSo I'd recommend buy these things offline if you want to maintain a strict workout regime without any disturbance in day to day schedule a few hundred bucks are still worth to spend if you want your body to stay fit.But I've used this product earlier for like a year now so I'd say it's good for beginners just maintain a strict diet and buy it offline to reduce unwanted stress Amazon isn't a good choice for buying consumable or edible goods I'm saying this from past experiences too.",1
499,Ashok,Disappointed.,1,3-Mar-19,I got these product and I checked it was authentic but it was becoming soapy when I diluted it..I don't know what the hell I got .Although delivery was fast😂😂,10
500,VIVEK KHULLAR,Quality issues worst product received from Amazon,1,9-Feb-21,Received a defect quality product from Amazon. Its stinking and unconsumed one. I have informed both amazon and muscle blaze about it. And the irony is that no one is showing zeal to take the  responsibility of there fault product. Poor service shown by amazon to its prime and certified buyer.,4
501,Manish,"Contains Maltodextrin, Protein content is very less per scoop",3,22-Nov-20,"Pros1. The flavor is good.2. The packaging is good.3. Mixability is good.4. It is okay for a price of Rs. 999.5. Funnily, it is enough sweet that you can use it as a substitute for adding sugar (if you have a habit of eating sugary food) because of its ingredients.Cons1. It contains Maltodextrin which has a very high GI, google and you would understand more, it is not a recommended ingredient if you have diabetes.2. The protein quantity per scoop is very less, so it might not be recommended if you have a little more experience or even for fast muscle recovery.3. Not recommended if you need insulin spike in your body.4. Not recommended for intermediate gym people.My verdict - It was good for a start but I am not gonna buy it again.If you really want Muscleblaze protein, go with MB Fuel one+.For students like me- If it is cheap, it doesn't mean it will be as effective, add 200 more and you can get unflavoured whey protein of MB which has higher protein content.",2
502,Preeti,Go for beginners,4,20-Jun-20,It's an excellent product to start with protein supplement...the flavour makes it palatable.if you wish to fullfill your daily basic protein requirement apart from food you consume...go for it and you will see the results.i was suffering from excessive hairloss..one of the basic reason is lack of enough protein... although I was having eggs regularly...the day I started consuming it..my hairfall has reduced to 60%.unlike other heavy duty protein supplement this will not harm your body if you skip your workout for the day,3
503,Vikram reddy,Show powder,1,12-Oct-21,"Disgusting powder ever had, got it and had 1 day in morning after workout ofcourse i had preworkout meal sprouts, evening something i felt wrong in my stomach, started to feel like heavy air is occupied in intestine and unable to get out. That feel was there for whole night. I will never use this brand in life, and i make sure no one in my friends circle will buy this product.",2
504,Akshay S.,Ideal for Beginners,4,22-Feb-21,"Beginners WheyPros1. Price : You can’t complain on this, don’t even try.2. Solubility is good, decent I’d say. Mix it with water/milk and grind for a smooth shake.3. Storage : Comes in an airtight jar4. Validity : You could easily check through the code given over the lid.5. Would easily last a month for 1 heap full scoop per day, depending on the usage.6. Taste : Everyone relates to this word “Chocolate”. Not bad at all.7. Certainly the best option out there for beginners and those seeking a budget friendly deal.8. Ideal Protein Content : Around 12 gms of protein is the safest bait for any beginner. Not more, no less.Cons1. Could cause digestion problems to lactose intolerant individuals and those with any history of stomach issues.2. If you’re not working out regularly, bloating is a possibility.3. A bit on the sweeter side. I like sweet, you may not though. Try adding more water or milk as per your taste.Note : Add water first and then the powder for ideal mixing and to avoid lumps.",2

It tastes better like cholate milkshake with milk though.I would recommend to use milk at night and avoid with milk at daytime who have digestion problem. 12g protein/scoop which is good.You can feel the result yourself.It wont help much for gains but it will for fat loss if you do appropriate exercise.Mixes very well,no foam or clumps are formed.Must buy product.",3

It says 12g per serving. If you calculate 30g of the substance for one serving then 12/30 is only 40 percentage whey. There are other products that exactly specify this, for a good one is around 84% or 84g per 100g. There are similar priced ones that has upto 80%. This means that the other 40 percent consists of maltodextrin which is like a filler substance that does not have any nutritional value. Do not buy.",3

520,Sanju Sukumar,Tasty & Mixes well!,4,30-Oct-18,"First of all it tastes super yummy. Not at all bitter which is the problem with other chocolate flavoured prlteins. Secondly it mixes very easily. The consistency is also smooth. However , Sucralose makes it really sweet whereas the package says there's no added sugar. Its understood tht sucralose is an artificial sweetener not sugar but where it says ""no added sugar"" it should be printed in brackets that sucralose is present. The results will be noticed later.",1

522,Vishnu soni,A real whey for The Bignner's,5,6-Jun-21,The best protien suppliment for bignners.Bcz it only gives 12gm of protien thats the only need of a bignner.As last tym i was using the normal whey which comprises 25gm of protien which cases sudden changes in my gastrosystem bcz i was not adapt to such a heavy dose of protein.

523,Santosh Kumar,"Bang for the buck, authentic product and lovely taste!",4,27-Mar-19,"I am totally in love with this Whey Protein powder from Muscle Blaze; the taste is so yummy and similar to a high quality chocloate milkshake. I believe this is an authentic Muscle Blaze product and all the people posting reviews  questioning the authenticity and pointing at the molding mark on the bottom of the box really ought to stop being so ignorant and read the product description on the images. Coming to the nutritional value, the protein content is pretty good for a beginner like myself although I feel the Carbs are slightly on the higher side but this is definitely still the best sugar free Whey protein product currently.",2

I've used this product for a month and am quite satisfied with the results. I was quite lean, but gained some weight and muscle mass after using it for a month. The flavor is good but not addictive, someday you'll feel that you should drop it for a day, but trust me, carry on as long as you can. And exercise is must, if you don't move a muscle then don't expect the protein to work properly. Cheers to Amazon and MuscleBlaze!",2

601,Ron Baruah,Great entry level protein suppliment,4,22-Jul-18,"This product was my entry into the world of protein supplements and by far it has exceeded my expectations. This is made of whey concentrate which compared to the other forms like whey isolate has 80% protein only, but bear in mind unless you are a gym freak 80% protein is sufficient for you as this won't be the only meal you'll have all day. It has a mild sweet taste, which I personally prefer more than a strong sweetness. And if you are wondering about the taste, the chocolate flavour is pretty decent too and you can easily convince yourself it is a chocolate milkshake. It has the essential amino acids and BCAA with nothing that can be harmful for you. Although it is optimized for use with milk I recommend using it with water as whey is already a part of milk and adding milk makes it a thick and a bit slimy, also you can keep the nutritional value from the liquid part of the shake zero with water.The major down point being the amount of carbohydrates in it. Ideally in order to lose weight and make lean muscles carbohydrates should be avoided, unfortunately this should be termed a carb shake with 12 grams of protein but 12.5 grams of carbs per 30g serving.Inside the packet there is a verification code to see if the product is genuine and also a 30g scoop within the powder.On a budget, this is a decent product but not a value for money.",4
602,Afroz mujawar,excellent product.,5,31-Mar-18,excellent product...the fluctuations in the body can be notified after 8-10 days with proper exercise..muscle starts to gain and it also increases weight....the best time to take this is at night which will help to recover the muscles,10

Doubtful that this was probably the cause for it, I stopped drinking it after 3rd week, and voila stomach problems all gone. After a week or so since a few scoops were left decided to have a scoop in the morning. Thankfully it was a holiday, cause that entire day I went 4 times to toilet, suffering from loose motions out of nowhere. All this experience, I don't know who else I can point fingers to. I think I am switching back to Healthkart supplements.",2
605,Mridul Joshi,Thumbs up for this product!,5,24-Jul-18,"I bought 1 kg beginner's protein recently and use the product after workouts. Initially, the product caused a bit of disturbance in the stomach and acidity issues but once I got habitual to this product, it works well for me. Make sure you mix the product well, until little protein powder bubbles mix homogenously with water and all of it gets properly mixed.It's a good product for beginners who undergo medium strenous workouts and this product proves to be a healthy supplement along with your regular diet.",4

Go for a higher Protein Percentage for Intense workouts.6. Almost sweet to taste if the drink is slightly concentrated.7. Freaking cheap for a protein supplement.8. Overall impression is great. Did it's job for me.",1
609,Ujjawal Arya,Perfect for newbies....,5,19-Jun-18,"This is perfect for the ones who have just started working out in gym and are worried about their nutrition for muscle recovery.You should not directly start taking standard whey protien because your body is not prepared to absorb 20- 30 grams of protein at once, this product helps the body to make a habit of absprbing nutrition from protrein shakes.",1

612,Shraboni Sinha,Very good quality protein.,5,7-Sep-20,"Whey protein is commonly used for improving athletic performance and increasing strength, but evidence to support these uses is mixed. Whey protein is also used to reverse weight loss in people with HIV and to help prevent allergic conditions in infants. Whey protein is a source of protein that might improve the nutrient content of the diet. Whey protein might also have effects on the immune system.This is a very high-quality Beginners WHEY protein. Beginners whey protein means it does not have a high amount of protein, which really good for beginners. Actually, protein consumption depends on your body habit, so if you are not habituated then there may be a problem occur to digest the whey protein. I joined the gym two months ago. That's why I brought this protein. It helps me to maintain the protein balance of my body. I just love its double chocolate flavor.--This Whey Protein is Gluten Free.--This Whey Protein Banned Substance Free.--There is a 33gm Scoop inside the container also.--It is fast-acting whey protein. Imported from the USA.--It is ultra-filtered Whey for less cholesterol, fat & sodium.--It contains Digestive Enzymes for faster absorption.--It can be mix easily using glass and spoon.--It is manufactured in an ISO certified company.--It provides 12gm Protein, 12.5gm carbohydrate, 0.95gm Fat, and 104KCAL in per scoop serving.It has 90% Isolated Whey Protein, Cocoa bean extract, Sodium Chloride, Xanthum gum (INS 415).  The presence of these ingredients is really a good sign of a good quality protein powder. It provides energy and enhanced body performance. It helps to recover fastly from tiredness also.It also has Digestive Enzymes like- Lactase, Papain & Bromelain. These Digestive Enzymes help to digest this protein very fast.This whey protein is instantized. That means if there is no shaker cup or any blender, just add one rounded scoop of this Whey protein to a glass filled with 6-7oz (200 ml approx) of water, low-fat milk, or any favorite beverage. Then mix it up with a spoon, stir it until the powder is completely dissolved.This Whey Protein can be used for more than just protein shakes. By adding fresh or frozen fruits, peanut butter, flaxseed oil, coconut, and other high-energy ingredients, can transform the shake into a delicious high-protein meal.It also can be consumed by mixing a scoop of it with oatmeal, yogurt.Take 1-2 servings a day or as suggested by the dietician. I take this Whey protein twice a day. I take it with water at the time of breakfast and in the evening after the Gym.--Please use this before 18months of manufacture.--Net Weight is 1KG.",2

614,Aditya Bhushan,Found INSECT and PLASTIC material inside the protein Jar,1,3-Sep-21,[ Buyers Read this review carefully ]When I purchased this I never thought such a disgusting incident can happen to me.After few weeks of usage when I serving my scoop I suddenly look into my jar and I saw something black and light brown substance.when I investigate it. It was a insect and a plastic material you can see all the pics I already attached.This is pathetic and very injurious to our health.Then I call firstly Muscleblaze ( they are just taking advantage on the tag of being Indian brand ).Call not connected. Then I email my issue and call again next day.MB customer consultant disconnect my call they are saying this is my fault ( Saying why this happened after long time ).( Where you kept the protein jar )( Why this happened in the bottom of jar if there is insect it comes just after opening )and some more silly replyTrust me they are not even apologize for their mistake.I am really disappointed from this.I will never gonna use MUSCLEBLAZE product I swear.I hope all the buyers think many times before using this cheap brand.,1
