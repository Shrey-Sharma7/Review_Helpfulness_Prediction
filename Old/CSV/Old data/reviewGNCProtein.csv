1,Hitesh Pant,Horrible choclate fudge- donot buy.,1,6-Sep-20,"Openend the package 5 minutes ago- As seen in the picture, the box is too big and the content is 1/4th less. So this led me to think, if its ingenuine, then i checked the code which said its original.Rest of the review will follow as I use it for some days.‚??‚??This part is after using it for some weeks-Very nice product. No lumps, easily moxes with a spoon. Taste is great. Easy to digest. No bloating. Will definitely use it again.‚??‚??‚??This part is after trying normal choclate, then vanilaa which was a lot of sugar. And then the worst experinece choclate fudge- only for choclate fudge, i didnt verify the genuine ness , hoping that thelast 2 products were genuine and so would rhis be.Thisis all together a different issue..i regret not checking the genuinesee..this one is way too sweet and plus forms lumps a lot of them and doesn‚??t mix at all, i eat the lumps..DONOT go for choclate dudge, and all of flaours, there was a small hole on the packaging, which i thought could be for ventilation, but orher reviews said, that it is a counterfiet product.Its been many months, i am unable to finish this choclate fudge, because it is very bad.My mother occassinally would share protein shake with me, bit this is very very very sweet. No body enjoys it.",13
2,Winter Soldier,Choco fudge > strawberry,4,25-Jul-20,"Though I personally feel, choco fudge is way better than strawberry flavor , however this is the best supplement for beginners and intermediate fitness enthusiasts.This flavour is Gluten free, but relatively higher cholesterol levels. Initially it tasted more like bubble gum than strawberry but I think my taste receptors aren't that efficient. However comparing this with my previous choco fudge whey, this makes a lot of froth/foam with cold water in the shakes, which settles after few minutes. Anyhow flavor have least priority for myself.  I combine this whey with muscle tech creatine and glutamine, which results in super gains and strength. After this stack is over , I'll definitely go with the GNC amp series whey along with creatine only.Thanks and happy Lifting ‚ù£Ô∏è",14
3,Chetan vaghani,Excellent product 10star product,5,31-Oct-19,"I used Mb Also but this one is better then mb , best product very light its iso that why ,5star rating ,now i dont hav blotiong issues",22
4,Neel Gangrade,I really like the Taste and its thickness,4,13-Mar-21,"I bought this product recently, came well packed as expected. i immediately checked the online for this authenticity. it passed the test. So the product delivered is original.Taste is really nice.. chocolate fudge. mixing with water and milk is good too. Here is the interesting thing i want to share. When you take it water it gets absorbed quickly. But when you mix water and milk together it takes really long time to get digested entirely. i did some test like mixing only with water then only with milk then mixing all three, the best results i got from water. So milk is a no go.Overall its a good product and i would recommend it for both beginners and experts. Hope this helps.",8
5,Dipankar S.,"Not mixable, protein floats and sticks in sipper",1,13-Mar-19,This product is useless. It does not mix at all with water after much trying. Chunks of protein floats in the sipper/ any container and sticks with them. However the sample which is 100% whey gold advanced series by gnc - that perfectly mixes with water. What a tragedy. I initiated refund and return on the same day. Next day someone from Amazon picked it up and I got the refund. So thumbs up to Amazon service and thumbs down to guardian healthcare or whether sells this product of gnc - either useless or fake product,21
6,Vijay Kedia,Waste of money !!,1,11-Mar-21,"This is not imported from US but made in India. The artificial sweetner taste in this protein powder is so bad that it stays in your mouth for some time after consuming it. If you need to buy a made in India product, there are much better products available at lesser price.",10
7,Amazon Customer,Good ans genuine,5,14-Nov-20,"I usually dont give reviews, but for this.I would like to say that what whatever I have ordered from Amazon so far came up to me as a genuine product,  I never had any regret after buying.People in gyms may say amazon is selling fake, but I have never encountered any instances like that.Even I ordered a pre workout and that was even great.Thank you amazon for providing such product at doorsteps.",10
8,Manish singh,Aunthicate and genuine product,5,9-Feb-20,"This is my third order and muat say its origenal stuff provided by Amazon, usley i used buy from shops but now i am happy with amazon product. Taste is good as m a professional bodybuilder m have with the results.",78
9,√§nurag mhatre,Highly recommended.,5,27-Nov-20,"Awesome product, though the delivery date was shown as 5 days later, I received it in 2 days only. Most loving part is the taste, it tastes awesome. The mixiblity is also good, after adding it to the shaker it dissolves completely in 1-2 shakes. Value for money product. Highly recommended.",10
10,Ishan Thakur Das,Best protein!,5,8-Dec-20,"I've been using GNC protein powder for years in the UK, one of the best out there. In India i find most of the protein powders bein fake or horrible so this is the best protein to try in India. Go for it!!",9
11,Sammy,Perfect for low budget holders,3,29-Oct-20,GNC is an forgein brand but the manufacturing takes place in india . It taste much better then labrada which is also in same range and manufactured in india . Luckily I recieved an orginal product and you can easily check the autheticity of this product by scratching the code and entering in GNC website to verify .Taste is kinda sweeter but atleast its not bitter so you can drink it easily in water and in milk it taste even better .57 servings for 3.3k is quite good . Best suited for people who want a good protein under 4k.,7
12,Ruptanu P.,Not impressive,2,21 April 2021,"The flavour is definitely on the sweeter side. To comment on the effectiveness of the protein, for me, it had the same results compared to other cheaper brands like Asitis and Musclexp. On the contrary, the protein is heavier to digest, which for me was the biggest issue. Whey is usually something which should be quick and easy to digest. Also, the amount of protein per serving, 24gms per 35gms scoop, is relatively very less as compared to other brands. GNC should definitely work on improving their products as there are far more better alternatives in the market which have better quality and results even at a cheaper price.",6
13,Avi Ashu,Good whey protein ...highly recommended for 3k budget,4,1-Dec-20,"Packing : well packedProduct : 100% genuine (just got for it )  , been in this fitness gym for the last 3 years and GNC protein is definitely good for lean muscle recovery and gains .Digestion : no digestion problem , no bloating , no acidity ...Taste : sweetness is well balanced and perfect . chocolate fudge is good ,better than vanilla or strawberry.Budget wise : best for the Indian market as compare to muscle blaze and other Indian products . GNC could have provided one shaker with the protein tub ...",8
14,Anshu Anshu,Good Product.,5,1-Mar-22,"I bought the vanilla flavour, been using it for a month. 1 scoop a day post workout.Pros:-Genuine product, I verified it via both Amazon's Transperency app & GNC webite.Tastes great, at beginning I felt it was a bit to sweet but then you'll get used to it.No bad aftertaste in your mouth.Digests quickly.Noticable difference in post workout recovery.Con:-Mixability can be improved, i notice lumps at times even after a proper shake.Overall great experience, will definitely purchase again.",70
15,Sanjay Navik,Excellent product and remarkable delivery,5,5-Nov-18,Was looking for balance Whey protein with good nutrient content... after various recommendations and research I choose GNC. It‚??s a excellent product with pleasant taste... value for money. Thanks to Amazon and Guardian on delivering the product within said time frame...,20
16,M¬ÆÔ∏èM¬ÆÔ∏è,people will die it‚??s fake,1,27-Nov-19,Cheap quality because of Indian Fake manufacturing,15
17,Shardul Khadye,Thick and tasty (chocolate fudge),5,31-Jan-21,"Initial impressions :Received original supplement , verified using official guardian website. Thank You amazon.Taste of chocolate fudge (with milk) is really really good.You will not even feel that you are having whey protein , the taste with milk is even better than ordinary chocolate icecream shakes and it is very thick also.I was using NutraBay product before buying this and I had good results with NutraBay too , I will update this review after 1 month usage of GNC.But the inital impressions are really awesome !",6
18,Asutosh S.,Tastes Terrible and Synthetic,2,22-Mar-19,"I have been a consumer of this protein for many years and used to love it. Earlier they would import this from the US and now they manufacture it in India. I am shocked how a company like GNC hasn't been able to maintain product consistency in their product. The Indian made product tastes very synthetic and nothing like the original thing. For a while, I didn't even know I had bought the original thing or not. But GNC confirmed it is. So I dunno if I will continue with this or just switch to a protein that doesn't taste this plastic. I am sure there are some compromises made to make the price affordable. Wouldn't recommend if you believe in quality.",8
19,RAJAT CHAUHAN,Should not order protein from amazon,1,2-Jan-21,"The gnc protein is excellent protein but the problem lies in the delivery. Amazon delivers damaged item like product with broken seal, instead of protein there will be something else. And you will face problems on return also.Clear advice is you should not buy protein on online platforms. Go to nearest store and buy it.",8
20,Harshit Narula,Excellent product best for muscle gaining,5,13-Feb-20,Excellent product. Best for muscle gaining it's very easy to mix unlike other whey protein.Using this product from last week and I'm amazed from the resultsGrate tasteDo take in water after gym for best results,76
21,Yash,No scoop inside how will I measure the about ?,3,5-Jul-22,"Useless seal. Doesn't hold the package from getting opened.Small dot hole in the seal, not sure why that is there.Worst part is, the container doesn't have scoop inside it. How am I supposed to measure the quantity of the amount that I'm taking ? Pathetic!!But scratch code does work. First i messaged them, i didn't got the response but after 5 mins  i checked on webside and it said the product is already been verified and the previous verification details was of mine only, that i did 5 mins ago. So the Scratch code does work!The container is bigger than the amount of protien in it. Hense looks half empty but weight seems to be as promised by GNC.It is Indian protein. Manufactured by Tirupati Wellness Private Limited, Surajpur.Will update the review after one month of consumption.",3
22,Kindle Reader,Poor Quality,1,26-Aug-21,"I bought GNC Pro Performance 100% Whey Protein - 2 kg (Chocolate Supreme) on 3-Aug-2021  which was sold by the vendor Cloudtail India on Amazon. The Guardian Authentication Code is UBBPY5GP. It came in proper packaging, the top was sealed, I scratched the code and it looked authentic except for one major issue that it is ""too sweet to drink"".I have bought this product 3 times now, really liked the first two times, and never experienced such a sweet protein powder before. It tastes bad with so much sweetness. The issue can be either it is fake or the product quality has got deteriorated. In either case, I'm not buying it again.",2
23,anita,Best whey protein,5,3-Mar-20,It's a pack of best chocolate flavoured protein.I purchased this protein for myself.Its taste is amazing and I was expecting the same.Trust me it's one of the best protein available in the market.,9
24,Jayram Gowda,Best in the price!!,5,24-Feb-21,Best whey protein in budget just go for it and in these reviews they have mentioned about the hole in the seal it's a technology provided by the company so that the box doesn't get damaged while transportation go for it I've got good results too,5
25,A.Sai Prathap,Recommended,4,24-Jul-21,Review after usage of 20days its good protein blend and getting results. It is super sweet. I couldn't able to drink banana shake cause of super sweet after adding this protien. Drinking this protien by mixing with 300ml water even it sweeet.Overall its good  protein getting nice results. Recommended protien.,3
26,Satyaki sanyal,GNC whey protein product review,4,14-Mar-21,"Hi,I started to workout seriously after a long span of 5 years.I have used whey protein from Ultimate nutrition and Muscletech and can say that the flavouring and texture of this product is at par. Now,coming to recovery,I can say that protein consumption and fish oil consumption reduces soreness overall but to see some changes in the mirror , it definitely takes a long time.Regards,Satyki Sanyal",4
27,neelam,"Too sweet, doesn‚??t mix well",3,16-May-22,"I‚??ve been using ON Whey Isolate for a long time and decided to try GNC to switch things up. Found GNC to be much sweeter- sweet enough to give me a sugar rush. Not very palatable. Also I noticed that it doesn‚??t mix as easily as ON does. While it is much cheaper than ON, I feel it is not worth the money saved. Will go back to ON after finishing this.",3
28,Keshav Mohta,Authenticity,1,8-Feb-20,The received product couldn't be verified by GNC website so either the product is FAKE or the code/audenticity verification by GNC doesn't seem to work. In all I don't know if the product is genuine and thus it can be harmful.,9
29,Raj,Wonderful product,5,20-Oct-20,"The product exactly delivers whats written in the box, I could see significant change in my muscle size and also increase in power while using the product. I have almost finished the first box and m all set to order the second from the same brand as well. Kudos GNC!!",6

31,Joseph Jacob,Satisfied,5,19 April 2021,"I have seen many people saying that the lid has a hole in it but believe me that hole is not by amazon that hole in the lid has been provided by the company. I have been in the fitness industry since past 3 years and to be true gnc provided me with the best results in these years. Good taste, Good results and better quality of muscle growth.",4
32,Rahul,Whey protein isolate,4,25-Oct-19,It is not same as the one which I bought in overseas.. Taste is same but the thickness is missing. Worthy and flavour is good.,8
33,Amazon Customer,Its not worth GNC brand,1,13 April 2022,I tried GNC because of someone's reference and i need to shake it for almost 15 min and then also it doesn't mix well.I contacted manufacturer and they also didn't respondwd the way they should i sent the video of shaking and the lums inside he said even i can't mix it this much well and he said this is perfect .I threw it its completely waste don't buy.,2
34,Ashish,TOO SWEET AND HEAVY BUT PERFORMANCE IS GOOD.,3,26-Jun-21,I do not like taste of choclate fudge because it's too sweet. It's too heavy after mixing it with water that's why I didn't try to consume it with milk.Protien is okay in this budget. Performance is good I can see muscularity in my body. Product is genuine because I have checked authencity through various platforms.,2
35,kapil,Authentic product as verified via GNC site,1,9 April 2021,"The product is authentic but if I compare it with the chocolate flavors which i have used several times. Adding a similar amount of scoop in water, the chocolate flavor holds the thickness and this strawberry doesn't.Definitely not expected from GNC, the product is definitely authentic (Manufactured -Mar 21) also the powder doesn't seems to be fresh .My advise is to stick to flavours which are widely verified and accepted by the consumers .A BIG NO TO CREAMY STRAWBERRY FLAVOUR by GNC",1
36,Anil Kumar Dubey,Nice strawberry flavor,5,28-Jan-22,"Nice flavor and taste. I have tried a large number of brands and this is one of the best. Must for post workout. Replace fatigue catabolic state body with anabolic state. Also consume carbs with good fats after workout to cover energy need. I will recommend this brand due to its price, quality and flavor. Must give it a try.",64
37,Kunal Dey,A good blended whey with great taste,5,2-Feb-21,Great tasting protein with good mixability. Result is also very good. This was my 4th buy of gnc pro performance whey 100%. It actually gives good result to gain lean muscle mass.,3
38,Amazon Customer,Third class product- very bad quality,1,2-Jun-22,"The product is very very bad - the protien doesn‚??t dissolve properly, which shows the poor quality; very bad taste; and when I contacted Amazon for the same, they said talk to the vendor/merchant, wrote them 2 emails with pictures, been a month and no courtesy to even reply yet",1
39,Jeeps,Awesome protein tasteful & adequate quality,5,17-Mar-22,The rate of choco fudge flavour is dam good very tarty you can have it with chilled water or milk.

42,Anant Jain,Has maltodextrin in it.,1,18-Jun-22,One should be mindful when reading the ingredients. Manufacturers are getting smarter. The protein is extremely sweet because of maltodextrin in it. A complex form of sugar that spikes insulin in your body post consumption.,1

49,Amazon Customer,Causes gas,2,2-Sep-20,I would suggest to buy a protein with no flavour and that does not contain artificial sweeteners. This causes flatulence. Try unflavored protein,2
50,Girish,The taste could have been better,3,1 April 2021,It doesn't readily dissolve in milk. And also does not tastes very good but manageable. But the response team was very friendly. They told me they would help me return it but they replied a little bit late and I couldn't return the product. Anyways I had to consume it and it's satisfactory.,1
51,Dhvani,Taste is fabulous,5,16-Feb-21,I think its the best tasting whey ever.. it tastes like a creamy chocolate ice cream. Best taste among whey protien ever for a reasonable cost,2
52,Aritra,The product has changed. Photos of old product are shared to mislead people,1,16-Sep-21,The nutritional profile has changed. The new one contains 3gm sugar per scoop and tastes pathetically sweet. It is still being sold using the nutritional profile of what used to be good whey.,1
53,Sid,Genuine product.,5,1-Aug-20,"For those of you wondering about that hole in the seal, it is for the passing of air so that the supplement doesn‚??t get soggy. It‚??s a genuine product but just verify again using the code.",4

I was using Optimum nutrition prior to this and found GNC to be better. It mixes well and I love the taste. GNC Pro Performance is the most effective whey protein both in terms of results and cost. And GNC have a very good product authenticity checking system via SMS which I was impressed with. Easy 5 stars.,
179,AJ,Good performance but too sweet!,4,12-Oct-20,"I have tried isolate by GNC before and obviously performance wise that is a little better.However, if we go by price per gm protein, pro performance is not a bad choice.The only let down for me is that it's too sweet! I mixed about a quarter of my old flavorless whey and still the sweetness is overpowering! Strangely it wasn't that sweet when I tried it about 6 months back. Maybe they tweaked it a bit to amuse Indian sweettooth like Coke in India.Nonetheless a good supplement whey in branded entry segment by one of the most trusted brand GNC!",

Scratch label is still intact but presence of such a hole creates doubt of its authenticity. Other Genuine protein bands does not have such a punch hole and resealing. Very doubtful Product!!!!Edit: After 10 days of use I found it is the worst in terms of mixability or absorbency, does not mixes fully in water. Lumps are left behind.",

Upon the recommendation of my gym trainer, I thought of trying GNC for the first time, albeit really scared.Got the product delivered on time, opened it, put a scoop of it in water to taste it, turns out all it tasted like was just pure SALT! Yes, you read it correct, whey protein tasted salty. Even the dry powder without water tasted salty.Never buying this product ever again. 100% fake product and not worth the hassle.",
185,Anmol Rai,It's a good whey protein..,5,16-Sep-21,"It's a good whey protein..The taste is amazing ""Chocolate Supreme""..It's authentic and it came with a scratch code with which you can verify the authenticity of this whey protein..However the results depend upon how you train and how much protein intake your body gets per day..I took three scoops per day, one scoop along with breakfast, two scoops with GNC Creatine after workout and sometimes one scoop at night but it's better you take casein at night because it's a slow digesting protein..You need to take the required amount of protein per day for Muscle Protein Synthesis so that your muscles can grow..So don't expect amazing results by just taking one or two scoops of this whey per day..Your diet must also include whole foods with good protein content along with this supplement..Foods like chicken breast, eggs, broccoli, pulses, cheese, yogurt, soya chunks, fish, nuts, peanut butter etc should also be taken along with this whey protein..If you do everything correctly, you will surely see the results..",

So this led me to think, if its ingenuine, then i checked the code which said its original.Rest of the review will follow as I use it for some days.‚??‚??This part is after using it for some weeks-Very nice product. No lumps, easily moxes with a spoon. Taste is great. Easy to digest. No bloating. Will definitely use it again.‚??‚??‚??This part is after trying normal choclate, then vanilaa which was a lot of sugar. And then the worst experinece choclate fudge- only for choclate fudge, i didnt verify the genuine ness , hoping that thelast 2 products were genuine and so would rhis be.Thisis all together a different issue..i regret not checking the genuinesee..this one is way too sweet and plus forms lumps a lot of them and doesn‚??t mix at all, i eat the lumps..DONOT go for choclate dudge, and all of flaours, there was a small hole on the packaging, which i thought could be for ventilation, but orher reviews said, that it is a counterfiet product.Its been many months, i am unable to finish this choclate fudge, because it is very bad.My mother occassinally would share protein shake with me, bit this is very very very sweet. No body enjoys it.",
189,Winter Soldier,Choco fudge > strawberry,4,25-Jul-20,"Though I personally feel, choco fudge is way better than strawberry flavor , however this is the best supplement for beginners and intermediate fitness enthusiasts.This flavour is Gluten free, but relatively higher cholesterol levels. Initially it tasted more like bubble gum than strawberry but I think my taste receptors aren't that efficient. However comparing this with my previous choco fudge whey, this makes a lot of froth/foam with cold water in the shakes, which settles after few minutes. Anyhow flavor have least priority for myself.  I combine this whey with muscle tech creatine and glutamine, which results in super gains and strength. After this stack is over , I'll definitely go with the GNC amp series whey along with creatine only.Thanks and happy Lifting ‚ù£Ô∏è",

So the product delivered is original.Taste is really nice.. chocolate fudge. mixing with water and milk is good too. Here is the interesting thing i want to share. When you take it water it gets absorbed quickly. But when you mix water and milk together it takes really long time to get digested entirely. i did some test like mixing only with water then only with milk then mixing all three, the best results i got from water. So milk is a no go.Overall its a good product and i would recommend it for both beginners and experts. Hope this helps.",
192,Dipankar S.,"Not mixable, protein floats and sticks in sipper",1,13-Mar-19,This product is useless. It does not mix at all with water after much trying. Chunks of protein floats in the sipper/ any container and sticks with them. However the sample which is 100% whey gold advanced series by gnc - that perfectly mixes with water. What a tragedy. I initiated refund and return on the same day. Next day someone from Amazon picked it up and I got the refund. So thumbs up to Amazon service and thumbs down to guardian healthcare or whether sells this product of gnc - either useless or fake product,

198,Sammy,Perfect for low budget holders,3,29-Oct-20,GNC is an forgein brand but the manufacturing takes place in india . It taste much better then labrada which is also in same range and manufactured in india . Luckily I recieved an orginal product and you can easily check the autheticity of this product by scratching the code and entering in GNC website to verify .Taste is kinda sweeter but atleast its not bitter so you can drink it easily in water and in milk it taste even better .57 servings for 3.3k is quite good . Best suited for people who want a good protein under 4k.,
199,Ruptanu P.,Not impressive,2,21 April 2021,"The flavour is definitely on the sweeter side. To comment on the effectiveness of the protein, for me, it had the same results compared to other cheaper brands like Asitis and Musclexp. On the contrary, the protein is heavier to digest, which for me was the biggest issue. Whey is usually something which should be quick and easy to digest. Also, the amount of protein per serving, 24gms per 35gms scoop, is relatively very less as compared to other brands. GNC should definitely work on improving their products as there are far more better alternatives in the market which have better quality and results even at a cheaper price.",

205,Asutosh S.,Tastes Terrible and Synthetic,2,22-Mar-19,"I have been a consumer of this protein for many years and used to love it. Earlier they would import this from the US and now they manufacture it in India. I am shocked how a company like GNC hasn't been able to maintain product consistency in their product. The Indian made product tastes very synthetic and nothing like the original thing. For a while, I didn't even know I had bought the original thing or not. But GNC confirmed it is. So I dunno if I will continue with this or just switch to a protein that doesn't taste this plastic. I am sure there are some compromises made to make the price affordable. Wouldn't recommend if you believe in quality.",

How am I supposed to measure the quantity of the amount that I'm taking ? Pathetic!!But scratch code does work. First i messaged them, i didn't got the response but after 5 mins  i checked on webside and it said the product is already been verified and the previous verification details was of mine only, that i did 5 mins ago. So the Scratch code does work!The container is bigger than the amount of protien in it. Hense looks half empty but weight seems to be as promised by GNC.It is Indian protein. Manufactured by Tirupati Wellness Private Limited, Surajpur.Will update the review after one month of consumption.",

The Guardian Authentication Code is UBBPY5GP. It came in proper packaging, the top was sealed, I scratched the code and it looked authentic except for one major issue that it is ""too sweet to drink"".I have bought this product 3 times now, really liked the first two times, and never experienced such a sweet protein powder before. It tastes bad with so much sweetness. The issue can be either it is fake or the product quality has got deteriorated. In either case, I'm not buying it again.",

While it is much cheaper than ON, I feel it is not worth the money saved. Will go back to ON after finishing this.",
215,Keshav Mohta,Authenticity,1,8-Feb-20,The received product couldn't be verified by GNC website so either the product is FAKE or the code/audenticity verification by GNC doesn't seem to work. In all I don't know if the product is genuine and thus it can be harmful.,
216,Raj,Wonderful product,5,20-Oct-20,"The product exactly delivers whats written in the box, I could see significant change in my muscle size and also increase in power while using the product.

220,Amazon Customer,Its not worth GNC brand,1,13 April 2022,I tried GNC because of someone's reference and i need to shake it for almost 15 min and then also it doesn't mix well.I contacted manufacturer and they also didn't respondwd the way they should i sent the video of shaking and the lums inside he said even i can't mix it this much well and he said this is perfect .I threw it its completely waste don't buy.,
221,Ashish,TOO SWEET AND HEAVY BUT PERFORMANCE IS GOOD.,3,26-Jun-21,I do not like taste of choclate fudge because it's too sweet. It's too heavy after mixing it with water that's why I didn't try to consume it with milk.Protien is okay in this budget. Performance is good I can see muscularity in my body. Product is genuine because I have checked authencity through various platforms.,
222,kapil,Authentic product as verified via GNC site,1,9 April 2021,"The product is authentic but if I compare it with the chocolate flavors which i have used several times. Adding a similar amount of scoop in water, the chocolate flavor holds the thickness and this strawberry doesn't.Definitely not expected from GNC, the product is definitely authentic (Manufactured -Mar 21) also the powder doesn't seems to be fresh .My advise is to stick to flavours which are widely verified and accepted by the consumers .A BIG NO TO CREAMY STRAWBERRY FLAVOUR by GNC",
223,Anil Kumar Dubey,Nice strawberry flavor,5,28-Jan-22,"Nice flavor and taste. I have tried a large number of brands and this is one of the best. Must for post workout.

Must give it a try.",

225,Amazon Customer,Third class product- very bad quality,1,2-Jun-22,"The product is very very bad - the protien doesn‚??t dissolve properly, which shows the poor quality; very bad taste; and when I contacted Amazon for the same, they said talk to the vendor/merchant, wrote them 2 emails with pictures, been a month and no courtesy to even reply yet",
226,Jiten Bhardwaj,Amazon is the problem,3,15-Nov-21,This flavour is very good. For all members of family this can be taken. The only √≠ssue is 1 out of 5 times the taste when ordered from Amazon is a dull variant. In fact it dosent taste as original choclate fudge. So be prepared to get something you didn't exactly ordered. Else order from gnc and while they have their own negative points but atleast we will need to depend on trust that what they are giving Is atleast original.,

228,Bhanu,Awesome,5,12-Sep-20,"Amazing taste and texture is just the one in premium brands like Gaspri and Muslepharm. Mixability is also very good. But taste is the best. Also for the people saying that there is a hole in the seal, I confirmed from GNC, it is not and has been done by the company. It's their new method of packing the product in which the hole is having very fine filter so that nothing goes in or out of the container except air and air pressure is equalised on both sides (for those who can understand). Total value for money product.",
