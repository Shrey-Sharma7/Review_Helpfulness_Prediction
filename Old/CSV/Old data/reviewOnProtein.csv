1,Yellowflash,Fake supplement alert,1,26-Jan-19,"Ordered the product on january sale and recieved today on 26th jan I was happy as I bought it for a very low price than the market and as soon as I got my hands on the product I opened it the first thing that shocked me that there is no interior lid covering this was strange and unusual as the product always comes with a interior lid although the seal was intact so I thought everything is right but as soon I smelled it my doubt on the authenticity of the product becomes crystal clear, I took one scoop and mixed it with water bingo it is not mixing with water. I dont know how this happens as the seal is from On is intactand also the distrubutor seal is also ok but how could this happen I cant understand that, abd from now no protein from internet. Tchao",

3,A Buyer,STALE stock: expire in 6 months (total 24 month). Suspected authenticity too - only box is authentic,1,4-Jan-21,"IT IS IMPORTANT TO UPVOTE RECENT REVIEWS TO ENSURE QUALITY IS MAINTAINEDI ordered ON 1 KG after a lot of deliberation. I regret the decision now. I had contemplated using the ""Subscribe and Save"" to get some discounts, but when they have no assurance on age of the product, it is pointless.Background: I ordered in Jan 2021 and got a product manufactured in June 2019. The expiry date for the box is June 2021. I did not check it prior to opening. Also it does not taste good (not like the previous ones I have had). It probably was not stored right as the TASTE HAS GONE BAD. Will not buy this ever again from Amazon.The authentication sticker validates the box - But the box itself is not tamperproof and the seal is more like a heat-shrink seal. Not sure it is authentic.",
4,Prabhjot,"Substandard, Made Exclusively for INDIA",2,21-Aug-18,"I am taking  On's Gold standard since years.i can't say its grey market product but definately something wrong this time. Bright commodities said its genuine product when i sent scratch code but its mixability is really bad, not even mixing with shaker and taste is less chocolaty,i dnt feel any heavyness in stomach after having it. Noticed few changes in packaging. It clearly says FOR EXPORT ONLY and they are printing India's FSSAI green mark on label in USA. Feels like its substandard product. Manufacturing exclusively for people of India. I dnt know whats wrong but its definitely not On's Gold standard Whey that we had earlier. Discarding it and switching to Rule 1 or wild whey",
5,Khagendra,Read It,4,19-Dec-19,"Brand is famous and doesn't need any review however it is bit costly because of it's popularity.Take it but with safety.1. Never take more than necessary protein because excess protein can damage kidney. Yes we believe if we take extra, we will be stronger however it has side effects and shoud be consumed in safe limit.2. When you take protein you must drink minimum 3 litres of water. Again drinking excess water helps kidney to flush out excess urea and also excess unconsumed protein.3. When you don't excercise, don't take it. Many guys keep consuming it even after they don't go to gym or workout. Don't take it as a health nutrition.4. When you visit any gym, the gym trainer try to brainwash you to buy protein powder. Never listen to the gym guy because he gets commision to sell protein powder. If you really need, get one. Also don't buy the brand suggested by gym trainer. To get high commission they suggest you any other brand and they don't care about your health. They just care about their commision.Thanks for reading. Cheers!",
6,Mahak Jain,Excellent...!!,5,25-Oct-18,Oh my god....its the most delicious flavor you can ever get in protein powder...it tastes exactly like rich coffee..add some ice cubes to it when you make it with milk...it will taste exactly like rich smooth cold coffee..whenever i drink this protein powder i feel like i want more....or you can have it just plain with water....both tastes equally good....If you are really a coffee lover go for it...!!!!Best..best...!!!,

13,shrey,100 percent Fake. DON'T USE FAKE NITROGENOUS PROTEIN POWDER.VERY DAMAGING,1,1-Jul-19,I have used this powder bought from USA and after it I bought it on Amazon and what i found is it's totally fake.1. There is a major taste difference.2. There is something white powder mixed in this product which was not present in USA product.3. It doesn't blend in with water easily as compared to usa product4. As a doctor i would not recommend to use a fake product in case of protein because protein is basically nitrogenous product and it can be very damaging for your body and kidney. Please don't use this fake product.,

?Package quality of instruction sticker very bad for India manuf double chocolate flavour, looks compromised for cost when compared to imported. I hope similarly the inner content of protein powder is not compromised. Difficult to say now. Compromise is evident on brand sticker which in itself is a proof that there may be compromise on quality for more profits, as the local manuf and plus is still same price, then why consumers to buy localised product with quality compromise. We may buy some other brand which is imported as In india the food quality checks cannot be trusted and stringent as USA quality. Very bad, now we can't trust the system authentication as the system authenticated product itself looks compromised. Manufactured in India was hidden by a sticker for some reason I don't know why. So it seems Optimum Nutrition wants just profits on his brand and any Tom Dick Harry will manuf in india.",

Following are the things you need to check and that determines the authenticity.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. The Seal. ON has it's black seal with golden ON hologram on it. It's the part of plastic and isn't any sticker.2. The Spelling mistake. ISOLATE & ISOLATES both are AUTHENTIC. ISOLATE is from USA & ISOLATES is from UK.3. The Bright Commodities Sticker and Scratch code which you can check by visiting their website.4. The BOX doesn't come with INNER SEAL. If you don't find SEAL INSIDE THEN IT IS AUTHENTIC.5. The INSIDE of the CAP. It has MADE IN USA written on it.6. The ON LOGO on the SCOOP. If the SCOOP HAS ON LOGO then it's AUTHENTIC.7. The MFD on the tub which will be TWO YEARS DIFFERENCE and WHEN SCRATCHED, IT GOES.8. The MIXABILITY of the powder, IT WILL GET MIXED VERY EASILY IN 30 SECONDS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------IF you get all the above things right then your product is AUTHENTIC.The product is really good and i could see the RESULTS FROM DAY ONE itself and it TASTES GOOD but the taste stays in your mouth for a while. I just use a glass and a spoon to mix and it MIXES IN 30 SECONDS leaving NO LUMPS.It FEELS LIGHT and DOESN'T BLOAT.

19,DOCTOR STARK,Don't think much. It's 100% original,5,12-Aug-21,"So I read a lot of reviews saying it's fake/Glanbia is providing fake products. Nope. It's not but to be on a safer side I went and thoroughly researched all the details. In India, there are 2 official distributers, Glanbia and Bright commodities. Glanbia's official distributor partner for Amazon is cloudtail. So I don't think anyone should worry product authenticity. Just make sure of three things-1.The scratch code is totally unscratched when received2. The lid has a golden hologram of ON3. The Scoop inside is transparent.Don't worry about anything else.Enjoy the shake! Smells and tastes wonderful???Hope this helps",

22,akshay kumar,Genuine product,5,30-Dec-17,"Brought this product through the seller cloudtail. I checked through few ways and found it to be a genuine product.How to identify:1. Check if there is a hologram (golden colour) at the cap2. Look for the manufacturing details and batch code at the bottom of the bottle . It should be in blue colour . The manufacturing date should be of a difference of 2 years exactly .3. Check for any spelling mistakes4. Scan the QR code and make sure it leads to their original site .5. Inside the bottle , there will be a scoop and it should be in golden colour with the ON logo .6. The powder should be very light like a talcum powder .Hope this gives you a better idea to check whether it?? genuine .Thank you cloudtail for delivering it in one day and I hope this whey protein gives me a good result .",
23,sandeep,Genuine product,4,6-Oct-18,"I bought it from cloudtail india and its a genuine product. I have used it twice and it is good for fulfilling the protein content required by your body. I will recommend to those who are doing workout, gyming or exercises and require high protein content for muscle building. If you can complete your required protein content by food like eggs, chicken breasts, etc then there is no need of this protein powder. Therefore don?? buy it blindly, firstly do analyse your body protein needs, workout goals and daily protein intake you are getting currently then go for it. No issues with the product and the brand as it is 100% genuine of Optimum Nutrition.",
24,Anurag,Good Quality Whey Protein,5,25-Jul-22,I purchased this product multiple times. Tast is ok for me. I check the authenticity code and packing after doing all the outer inspection its time to check the inside stuff. As we all know pure protein is not heat soluble so I would take some water in a cup put 1 to 2 teaspoon of the whey protein powder mix it and put it in the microwave for 2 mins. After two mins you will find the powder has turned into solid in indian language it will be like (fata hua dudh). We are set and ready to use the product tension free and focus on working out and putting extra effort.,
25,Antra Maurya,Changes in Authenticity check,4,10-Jan-22,So I watched a lot of YouTube videos regarding ON authenticity.My product did not have an importer tag also there was no blue expiry date on the bottom.So I called ON customer support and the agent mentioned below points-1. Glanbia (importer) now imports raw material from US and packaging is done in India. I guess the plant is in Himachal and established some 6 months back.2. There will be no importer tag in new ON boxes.3. Expiry date and batch number is now printed on back of the box in a white space with black ink and not on the bottom.4.No vaccum cover on the lid intead a pasted seal.5. Check authenticity by the TRU SEAL (which we all do).,

29,Amazon Customer,"May cause bloating, be aware",1,5-May-20,While it's rated to be a decent whey supplement but it may cause bloating especially for people who may not have a very strong digestive system which people usually don't.

30,Skt,Worst experience,1,13-Feb-21,"Ordered on 5 Feb and received 8 Feb .I could not authenticate the product and the customer care did the authentication of the product on my behalf ! I wonder what different procedure they did and it got authentication right as there are only 2 ways to do so ..I opened the jar and it had no seal in the inside to protect it from moisture ..I was not able to mix it well with the water ..The smell is something weird and also taste is something like a cough syrup nothing like a double chocolate..The consistency is too wattery after mixing.The 10 Days Return / Replacement is a total scam with this product , so don't believe what the tab below the product says! As you try to get it replaced or try to return it, they can only connect you to the Amazon customer care who in turn will ask  to mail and connect with the manufacturer.Overall not worth and a disappointment. Don't buy this product online !!",

Some powder leaked out. I could actually tighten the cap even without opening the seal. One thing I don't like about ON is that the tubs don't look premium and the seal system is inferior to the price we pay.About this purchase, I think it is genuine. I have checked the 6-digit code in the website. Moreover it looks, feels and tastes exactly like the ones I normally purchase in the UAE.About the flavor(Rocky Road), it is good, but I still think 'Double Rich Chocolate' and 'Chocolate Malt' are better.",

I authenticated the product on Optimum website as well as had a call with the customer care- they told me due to environmental concerns the plastic  for the scoop is now transparent.

2172,Nitish Negi,A very well presented FAKE powder,1,19-Jul-18,"Well this is a very well done FAKE product.Now you guys must be wondering that how am I this sure about the quality of the product.So here it goes.I have been consuming this product from the last 1 year. And every time I have asked my known ones to get it from any GNC store in USA.So from the beginning I have consumed the genuine product.And now comes the interesting part. Why I am sure that this product is not Genuine.So the one I ordered from here was sweet like a chocolate powder that is used to make chocolate shake. The original GNC one I ordered was not sweet at all. It tasted all bland. Moreover the Sugar Content in the ingredients of the packing is 1gram per serving. Low enough that you just won't taste it. Just as in case of the GNC one.Also, when I first opened the jar, there were a hell lot of white particles all around the powder that were not mixed. I never saw anything like this in my previous protein of same make and type.Checkout the image I have attached.Another one was the powder seemed to be as if moisture has had its effect on it. The one I consumed from GNC was just like ""Maida"" with not moisture.Now at last, this is a very well presented fake product.Think I am just defaming it? Go ahead! Buy it.I don't care if you still want to have it.But would love to at least speak it out and help someone who isn't aware of such things.Peace!EDIT: Tried placing a replacement order just to see if I accidentally received the fake one. But to my surprise, it was 'MORE FAKE' than the previous one. This time, not only the powder but the whole packaging was copied and was fake. There was ""S"" missing in the ""ISOLATES"" in from on the box. Also, there was a difference in the design of the label.Have placed a return now.",

I played safe and bought it.  There are a few things i was considering while buying a supplement and 1 of them was safety.

Like others, I was also in doubt whether the product will be original or duplicate cos duplicates are also available in market. But guys this product is 100% original and I showed to my gym trainer also. It mixes well with water and you can bear it's taste as well.  In the product description they have mentioned few guidelines just to make sure the product is original. Make sure you see the expiry date as well. It was delivered on the expected date with a very good packaging. Totally loved it!",
2176,Srivas,Great Protein powder; mediocre flavor (Rocky Road),4,28-Oct-15,"I have always used Optimum Nutrition as my primary source of protein. I find it better than most other brands, and even though it's quite expensive, I feel that the extra price you pay is worth it.I have always used the Vanilla flavor, and this time, thought I'd shake things up a bit and try a different flavor for a change. Rocky Road is good, but a bit too creamy, in my opinion. Maybe my taste buds are just used to vanilla, but the Rocky Road flavor always leaves an aftertaste in my mouth, which I don't like at all. If you're getting it, I suggest getting some other flavor.Vanilla, Chocolate and Cappuccino are all great flavors.The product itself is original, and came with the authentication sticker (Seller: Primarc Pecan Retail; They are the official importers in India for ON). I don't know why so many people claim to have gotten a spurious product, because I always order this from Amazon, and have never received a duplicate.",
2177,Shubhadeep Mukhopadhyay,TAKE TIME & READ THE WHOLE REVIEW THOROUGHLY. I hope you will find every tiny detail that you want/need in this review.,4,21-Mar-18,"I WILL GIVE THE FULL REVIEW POINT BY POINT (with attached Photos). ENJOY AND KEEP READING, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.Just to clarify and to be honest, this is the first time I'm using a Whey protein, not just the brand but Whey protein itself. Though, I was very skeptical about the purchase after reading so many reviews about the product being fake, I still decided to order it.ABOUT THE JAR/TUB (AUTHENTICITY CHECK from the outside): There was a strong chocolate smell on the outside of the jar already. I checked the bottom of the jar and the tub looked normal. Mfd and Exp date had exactly 2 years gap. I did not find any tampering marks whatsoever.There was the ""ON Authentic seal"" on the neck band. I checked everything thoroughly before opening it. The QR code on the jar itself led me to product page of Optimum Nutrition website.The QR code on the importer sticker led me to Bright Commodities authenticity checking page. I scratched the Importer sticker for the hidden code and entered all the details and it said that the product is authentic.After opening the jar, I did find the seal attached on the lid.The jar was kind of half filled, not up to the brim. (Doubt 1)I also found the golden scoop with the branding on it and Made in USA written inside the scoop along with some other details.SMELL, CONSISTENCY AND TEXTURE OF THE POWDER: The power smelled nice and the texture was normal I think (First time user), not clumpy or anything.No stickiness at all, the powder did not stick to the inside of the jar. (Authenticity checking method found somewhere online)One thing that I noticed was that, the powder had some white particles in it. (Doubt 2)Now, to clear out my doubts I called 011-49594959 which was Glanbia Performance Nutrition. I followed the instructions given by the IVR and asked about my doubts. The customer executive was helpful enough and told that ""The product is 100% authentic. The jar is supposed to be filled half way and the white particles are 'Amino Acids'.""I was satisfied with all the authenticity checking and all.TASTE: Though it smelled really chocolaty, the taste was just okay. According to me, it had a medicinal taste to it.Consistency was okay, not thick at all, it might just be the amount of water I added. (1 full scoop in one glass of water)MIXABILITY: It mixed with the water fairly easily. Found 1 tiny lump, and by ""tiny"" I really mean tiny, most of the people won't even notice it probably. I noticed it because I was trying to find lumps intentionally. Now, keep in mind that I did not use a shaker, it was simply stirred with a spoon in a glass. I did not even stir vigorously. So, mixability is good I think.RATING: Now, talking about the rating, I gave it a 4* just because the taste was okay.",
2178,Amrut,FULL REVIEW,5,9-Oct-17,"First of all would like to appreciate amazon for the fast delivery, cuz I got the product in 1 day of ordering.I was worried after seeing the reviews that my whey could turn out to be fake and I will regret buying from Amazon but it turned out to be genuine and although the Amazon seller was Cloudtailindia the product is indeed imported by Bright commodities which is the official importer of ON in india. To check the authenticity of the whey always watch videos on YouTube regarding ""how to identify fake ON whey from original one's"" before buying so that you can check it quickly once it arrives.Make sure on the day of the delivery you install a QR and barcode scanner app on your smartphone to quickly scan the codes on the tub which will take you to the official ON Website. As of the whey itself I'm completely relieved because it genuine and it's a trusted and no. 1 brand through the decade.i'd ordered double rich choc.My review on the product :1)TASTE - 8/102)MIXABILITY - 9/10 (always mix w/ cold water/milk)3)QUALITY - 10/104) EFFICIENCY* - 9/10..*efficiency could relate from person to person since it's based on many factors such as age, workout intensity,diet, dedication etc.dont expect to build a muscular body without working out hardcore in the gym and maintaining a healthy diet of egg whites,chicken,veggies and protein shake(remember it's a supplement not a whole food)THANK YOU.if any doubts feel free to dm me on Insta - amrut_p49",
2179,Prithivi Raj,"Rocky Road, OSM PAWSOME.",4,16-Mar-16,"I have Already given a review about the authenticity of this product. If possible find that post in which i have included the pic of the official whey gold standard suppliers in India's name. Now this is all bout flavor. :P OH MAN!  Had the best experience today with rocky road, which reminded me to write a review. IT IS FREAKING YUMMIEEEEE. Now you see I'm not a sweet tooth. Sweet or no sweet i like. But this.. this is osm. one among the best. Heard "" MILKY CHOCOLATE "" is like 20 times better than rocky road! o.O REALLY? well to find that out, I did a Evil deed by suggesting it to my friend, his product is about to arrive, will have a sip of it and let you know about that taste too. ;)I take my protien with coconut water - Review - Sweet, Refreshing, and Yumiee.I take my protien with plain water - Review - Little Bland, Yummie. (( Little is actually a perfect word here, only a little you can hardly tell. ))I Take my protien with milk ------- Review ------- MAN MAN MAN! I JUS WANNA DRINK IT ALL DAY LONG, ALL THE TIME.

2180,Leila,A good source of quality PROTEIN!,4,28-Nov-14,"The product has a rich pleasant flavour. More importantly, it mixes very easily and there are no lumps. The measure scoop is handy. For those seeking good quality protein supplement and have a taste for chocolate - well, Optimum Protein 100% Whey is the answer. The pricing is a little on the high side which may put off younger groups with less fat wallets.",
2181,shrinivas patil,Good product with excellent service by Amazon,4,28-Mar-15,I bought this Amazon fulfilled product. It was sealed perfectly leaving no doubt oftampering. Amazon service was excellent and I received the product on time. The protein is good in taste and provides the required energy for workout as well as a good energy replenisher post workouts. It mixes well with water with no granules left behind. The chocolate flavour is good and is not too sweet . I am satisfied with the product .,
2182,Amazon Customer,Fake Product,1,10-Oct-17,"Usually I order via health cart and products were good. The current product taste bad, does not mix well and no way a original product. Amazon must take extra protection so that consumer are not duped or money more importantly health. Will never take risk with these kinds of products at Amazon. Very very disappointed.",

Many a days I go to the gym just to have this great tasting drink!! 100% satisfied.. Exceeded my expectations!!!",
2184,Naveenkumar,Orignal product and few things need to be known,5,6-Aug-15,"Received Original product. had Hologram in nect of the Jar. I like to share few things for the below questions and which degrades the quality of the seller and ON  and for the negative comments we see in net.1)No hologram on the 1 lb - I have seen complaints about the Primarc pecan sellar. What I believe is, They dont sell fake product and damage their brand name. People search for hologram in 1 lbs jar and they say its fake product since they dont find them. actually 1 lbs doesnt come with Hologram since it's almost like a trial pack. you can simply confirm the authenticity from the Aroma when u open the Jar. (They didnt update the images- the product u receive might have 23g of protein which is not gold standard)2) Jar is not sealed inside - To verify this, I have searched couple of vids of unpacking the ON 2lbs in which White lid is not sticked and covered the Jar opening instead it was attached to the cap. So dont think u have a fake product when u see the white lid is attached with the cap of jar.3) I dont see the result - I am not sure why guys are expecting so much outta it. It s just a supplement. You gotta eat healthy and must be taking proper amount of protein, fat and carbs with proper workout routine. If u miss out any one of this, you will not see proper result. some body structure may not digest this supplement as expected. In worst case, U might not see the result :( (You can skip the Supplement and it can be compensated with Proper foods).Some tips- Eat - Egg white, Whole wheat bread, chicken breast, oats(complex carbs) ,avoid sat fat and trans fat and drink at least 5 lts of water per day. All the best Guys..",
2185,Durgesh Kothari,Good product although I prefer Dymatize for taste,4,31-May-15,"Nice product but the taste is just ok. I prefer Dymatize Caf? Mocha as the taste is much richer and tastier. I definitely feel stronger since using whey protein. On bodybuilding.com a US site, they rated ON as one of the best brands. I don't trust the Indian brands although cheaper because they aren't properly regulated or testing in India.",
2186,Suresh Kumar,firstly i would like to say that i am doubtful about the product ...,3,17-Aug-14,"Hi all, firstly i would like to say that i am doubtful about the product bcoz after openning the lid of the jar, there was no seal on the mouth of the jar. so plz if anybody used this product before , then tell me that is it ok ? or something wrong with me. so plz  reply me fast or post ur review plzzzzzzzz...........",
2187,Rajiv Pillai,Great to taste with a promising nutrition,4,14-May-14,"For a first timer, I must admit that the taste of Double Chocolate is definitely good. It's too early and too little to comment about the health benefits but hopefully it should be great as well. The only drawback as compared to Nutrilite Protein Powder, is that this isn't a family protein powder. You can't give it to children below 18 who need protein equally well.",
2188,PS,Simply awesum number 1 product always,5,25-Jan-16,"One of the finest whey protein supplement we have in the market is this one, i am using it from past 4-5 months and i must say that i saw a huge difference in my muscle gain ability, yeah it also depends what diet you are taking , but this supplement is best even bodybuilding.com also announced it number 1 product, so without even thinking just go for it you will start feel the difference in muscle gain within one month.",

For results you should atleast wait for 3 weeks. About the authenticity , check site and make sure you are ordering from the official importer.September and november : prime peccanUpdate december : purchased from cloudtail. Recieved and damaged box with a lot of scratches ( mfg date 06/16)",
2190,SudR,Fake and disappointing even amazon couldn't guarantee the quality.,1,13-Jan-18,Bought this product from cloudtail and tried with just 6 oz of water. Recommended water level is 6 to 8oz.. Its totally run down and there is not a bit of chocolate taste in mix.  Extremely unhappy with the fake ones sold even on a site like amazon.. They conveniently marked the product as non returnable.. Very upsetting to see how low they are reaching to make money even on food items.,
2191,Akhil P Walia,Best Whey,5,26-Sep-16,Genuine import and tastes good. Even though I am not cash strapped...but I still find it expensive......every time I make my drink..I am ultra careful about not spilling even a small amount out of the jar or under the fan. I ensure I drink each and every drop to the last!,
2192,Karsh,Fast Delivery. Tastes Great!,4,26-Sep-17,"The tub has a capacity of about 4lbs but they're handing out those for 2lbs of whey. Genuine waste of plastic and resources.Other than that, it tastes pretty good n doesn't need any additional sweeteners like sugarfree.The delivery was really quick. Received my order in just 2 days.NOTE: If you want to check whether the product is Original, use the QR Code on the box. When you scan it, it should direct you to the official ON website with all the details about your product. If the Code doesn't work, then its FAKE.Also i'll update my review after a month to let ya'll know whether it helped me with muscle growth or not.",

2194,Madhav,Please double check before you place the order,5,25 April 2017,"Received on Time,Scanned the QR on the box and found that the product was authentic as per the qr code on the boxNot sure about the importer, coz I placed an order with ""Primarc Pecan Retail "" and I see the importer name as ""Bright""Taste was not so great, I prefer, Vanilla or strawberry to that of Chocolate, tried it for the fiurst time.",
2195,OEL,Disappointed!,1,1-Dec-17,"It was not sealed when delivered, anyone could adulterate it therefore the experience started with shaky confidence. Taste really bad, so bad that my body immediately rejected it by puking it out. I ordered chocolate flavour but all I got was sawdust and so it further reinforced My vote of no confidence for the product. Then I finally lost complete confidence when it had no result. I have been using this for over 2 months and nothing. My previous protein had better result within a month. I will go back to using that. so to encapsulate...1- Wasn't sealed, 2-Taste like sawdust, 3- No result. What do you think I bought ?",
2196,Amazon Customer,Just outer Seal?,4,16-Dec-15,Everything was fine until I found out that inner seal was missing. However when I searched about this issue many say that it will be packed either with inner or outer seal with ON Hologram and the whey powder will give out strong odour when opened and yes it did. When I verified the product with ON and ON distributors in India and said my product is genuine and also from the links it matches how real product this is to be when I crosschecked with fake Whey. So guys container should have either inner or outer seal.,

But the product within is adulterated. I compared this with the same stuff bought from US and I could clearly taste the difference. The original product tastes like your health drinks (like boost, bournvita) It has a rick chocolaty flavor. This product, on the other hand, has a mix of chocolaty and bitter taste.",

I received a genuine product two months ago but I have received a completely FAKE bottle this time. I have highlighted all the differences between the genuine (left, green circles) and fake (right, red circles) product. The fake powder does not dissolve completely and has white flecks in it. DO NOT follow the QR code on the white sticker. It leads to a fake website. The correct QR code is on the bottle next to the barcode itself and leads to the ON USA website.",

2205,Atul Nemlekar,How to check whether it's a genuine product.,4,4-Mar-18,"1. On the containers lid there is one golden colour ""ON Gold Standard"" sticker which is sticked on to the black protection seal.2. There are two QR codes:i) ""ON"" Container QR Code-It is imprinted on the left hand side of the barcode, after scanning this QR code the official website of ""ON"" will be opened.ii) Disributors QR Code + Serial Number- The second QR code is of supplier in which there will be one QR code along with that a serial number  will be provided which is hidden under a silver sticker. Just scan this code and enter the details along with your serial number, this will show you whether your product is genuine or not.3.

Simply blown away with the results!I could feel the difference in the very first week of taking in On Protein Whey (Gold Standard).I take it before workout for protein synthesis and in the evening to keep the protein synthesis constant.Combine it with cheap protein sources like egg whites, brown bread, and chicken for effective results.Personally preferred Double Rich Chocolate taste over Mocha Cappuccino.A little overpriced for the average Indian consumer. Go for it if you need just the BEST Whey Protein Supplement for your workouts!Highly Recommended.",

2558,Vaibhav Marathe,The best whey protein since 11 years,5,30-Nov-17,"On Gold Standard 100% Whey protein is continuously winning awards from 11 years as the best isolate whey protein and i'm using it from 2 years the best ever whey protein with the best results you get. Well talking about the flavour that it has More than 18 different flavours than any other whey protein manufacturer has.For better results take it immediately after your workout and try to take minimum 2 to 3 scoops daily as i take 1 scoop one hour later in morning after breakfast mixed with yoghurt and 1.5 scoop after workout in evening but keep in mind don't eat for 1 hour after consuming it let it get digested and then take your meals otherwise you are wasting your whey protein.Tips to find the product is genuine or not1. Lot Number : Every optimum nutrition product has a lot number which signifies that it belongs to the original ON product batch. This number can be found on the bottom of the jar.2. MFG and Expiry Date : Always check manufacturing date and expiry date. An expired product is of no use because it can give you serious side effects.3. Product Label : ON Gold Standard 100% Whey?? product label is printed with dark and vibrant colors with a shiny and smooth finish. You should check the label thoroughly, it should not look flimsy. It also lists 24g WPI, 5.5g BCAAs and 4g Glutamine. You should check that this info is correct on your label.4. Grammatical Errors : There is no room for grammatical errors on Optimum Nutrition?? product label. If you find any errors on the product label then it is fake.5. Check Seal : The container should be sealed properly from outside especially the lid is properly sealed if ON Gold 100 Whey is genuine. The seal is shiny and also the lead. Do not accept if there is no seal.6. Check Manufacturer?? Address : All ON products are mostly manufactured in the USA, so your Whey protein container should have the USA manufactures address. Check the back of the container.7. Scan The Bar Code : On the jar you will find a QR code and a bar code. Just scan these codes with your smartphone by using a QR code scanning app. It will show you product details. If the details come to be about ON Gold Standard 100% Whey then its genuine otherwise fake.#Flavours are rated above.??Extereme milk chocolate 10/10??Double rich chocolate. 9/10??Chocolate mint 8/10??Vanila ice cream. 8/10??Rocky road. 7/10??Mocha cappuccino. 10/10???Birthday cake. 7/10??Although my favourite is mocha cappuccino and extreme milk chocolate but mostly i take mocha cappuccino Because it taste little bit like coffee and i take it in cold low fat milk that's why it taste like cold coffee.So guys i think you will find this helpful.??This time the packaging was worse the jar was damaged but it is genuine.

2567,Amazon_Shopper,Best whey protein on earth. Tips to find out the fake ones.,5,25-Mar-17,"First of all I didn't buy this whey protein from Amazon. I bought it from authorized neulife store. Double Rich Chocolate is the best flavor of ON 100% Whey and has a mouth watering taste even with water. Milk gives more rich taste and you will feel that you just have eaten a double chocolate drink. Its taste is awesome.Now I am here to tell you guys about spotting the fake ON Whey protein and also I will address some misconceptions about this product which are unnecessarily degrading its value.Tips to check the genuine ON Whey1. First of all if you are worried about the genuinity then I would suggest you buy ON protein only from three sources. These three sources are neulife online store (neulife online store), neulife retail store, and finally Cloudtail India on Amazon. There is no doubt that neulife is the oldest importer of ON products in India so you can buy from them with confidence. I contacted Glanbia India customer care and they have confirmed this that neulife directly imports ON products from Glanbia and they also said that Cloudtail India is also their trusted ON whey seller. If you are buying from Cloudtail and getting ON Whey with a 'Bright commodities' sticker then it's all genuine.2. Neulife has a better system of verifying their ON Whey products. Every neulife ON Whey product has a unique code, QR code that you have to scan or SMS to neulife to verify it. I instantly got a message that ""My ON whey is genuine"". You can only verify it once though.3. The double rich chocolate flavor is awesome and when you mix it with water it forms a white creamy layer and taste if awesome exactly like double rich chocolate.4. If you are mixing one scoop with little water then it will the real chocolate taste with very very little bitterness exactly like a dark chocolate. It is sweet also. The bitterness is sometimes unnoticeable, this bitterness feels exactly the same on tongue after eating a dark chocolate.5. DRC flavor smells like chocolate and have tiny white in it.6. Comes with golden seal which is printed on the black label.Misconceptions:Some people say that they are getting fake supplements and half of the powder is fake. Some also say that the sellers cut the container from the bottom and remove the original powder and fill it with some fake powder. But I checked my container from inside after emptying it and found that the bottom is intact from inside and no sign of cutting the container was found. Please check attached images for clarification.But if you buy from neulife then there is no problem. Cloudtail India sells genuine ON whey as confirmed by Glanbia Performance Nutrition, but I can't say about the delivery agents. Buying supplements online are also not good in summers as these supplements need cool places to store while during transit the whey powder go though heat which may degrade its quality.If you are going to GYM then stay away from trainer's advice over this and never buy even if he gives you heavy discounts. This gym trainers will never give you the protein imported legally, they will either sell you grey market stuff which is mostly fake or they sell you supplements that are imported from unknown sources. Stay away from these fake trainers if you love your body.I was shocked to know that my GYM trainer doesn't know about neulife.So buy your protein from neulife or cloudtail only. Also stay away from low quality supplements like MuscleBlaze, don't get fooled in the name of made in India whey protein. ON is the best whey protein in the world. It is light on stomach and won't give you headaches or stomach pain. It is digested easily and helps in muscle building.Attached images for more info.",

I thought I will clarify this as many people are thinking it is fake due to non presence of inner seal...

2654,Rajat Sharma,Tell me,3,1-May-17,If a beggner this product is helpful for muscle build,
2655,Nagarjuna,Great product,4,8-Sep-16,Top quality product.,
2656,Prime Customer,Use common sense,2,17-Aug-17,"You dont need supplements to build muscle.Because for body weight of 76kg you need nearly 150g of protein.And whey protein gives 24g for 1scoop so if 2lb is around Rs.3000 each scoop costs Rs.100 and you are still at deficit of neatly 135g.Chicken is even better a kilo costs Rs 130 and boneless breasts costs Rs. 200 and 100gm of the same costs Rs 20 and gives 31g of protein and 1gm fat. So having twice gives you 61gm of protein and costs Rs. 40 and with milk, eggs & oats, roti/chapati & rajma/channa/chole gives you full protein daily requirement all totalling under Rs. 100.So it makes no sense to buy supplements. Its like this as if you drinking horlicks makes you taller stronger and sharper and you've been drinking it since your childhood and you know the results.I am not saying taking supplements wont build muscles it does actually. But it makes no difference if you take chicken or egg or whey protein or milk. Protein is protein.All that matters is meeting your daily protein requirement of nealy 1.5 or 2gm of protein / kg of body weight and incase you are deficit in your daily requirement of say 25g you supplement it with supplements hence the name supplements ie you complete your deficit gap by supplementing it with shakes.And it makes no sense to make it as primary protein food and drink 6 scoops to meet such requirement spend Rs.10000 a month when normal food costs under Rs. 1500 and meets all your requirement.People in US usually take 2 scoops not because whey protein builds more muscle but because a pound of chicken or ~450g costs 6-8 dollars which can make up for 2 or 3 servings or one to one and half days so for a month it costs them considering $7 as average it costs $210. So in US whey protein is cheaper but in india chicken is cheaper.Its all consumerism they want you to buy so that they can make money.WRT preworkout creatine it makes no difference its just placebo effect. Ive used it for 2 years. Your strength grows naturally over time with or without creatine just eat proper normal food. And there is no better pre workout than a banana/rice",

2669,Amazon Customer,Two Stars,2,27-Oct-16,the price of this product is 800 high.why?,
2670,Aryan Padhy,Great experience. Quality ???,5,2 April 2021,I think the flavour is a bit concentrated. Expected a milder flavour . Researched that it's the best flavour. Best Taste is subjective.I think chocolate banana would be better. Regarding the authenticity and quality of the product I have no doubt. Amazing work Amazon and cloudtail. It passes every verification procedure. Also the product has validity till 2022,
2671,Sho,Ok ok product,2,4-Jul-21,ON is too costly and gives same effect like muscleblaze. Main issue with ON is they are not researching on this product and bloating issue with this product is still not resolved. ON should improve this product by adding stevia and digestive enzymes.,
2672,Amazon Customer,"Good, Authentic",5,28-Sep-21,All good. only issue is its not easily digestible but again this varies from person to person.Check authenticity on ON website by entering scratch code. You can also see authorised sellers there and cloudtail is one of them for Amazon.,

2674,ayush,First delivery didn?? seem genuine. Replacement delivery looks genuine,5,28-Oct-21,First time it was delivered I was not able to scratch and find the code only to verify the geuinity. So I had to replace the product . The replaced order was however genuine . So basically first time I was not sure of the genuineness of the product but second replaced product seems genuine. One has to be very careful with the product . Chances of fake product cannot be ruled out,
2675,Arjun,Look for one that provides proof of authenticity,5,27-Aug-21,"There are lot of good products in the market. If you feel this is expensive, just go for one that is cheaper but provides a proof of authenticity. There are also many fraud products.",

I regret the decision now. I had contemplated using the ""Subscribe and Save"" to get some discounts, but when they have no assurance on age of the product, it is pointless.Background: I ordered in Jan 2021 and got a product manufactured in June 2019. The expiry date for the box is June 2021. I did not check it prior to opening. Also it does not taste good (not like the previous ones I have had). It probably was not stored right as the TASTE HAS GONE BAD. Will not buy this ever again from Amazon.The authentication sticker validates the box - But the box itself is not tamperproof and the seal is more like a heat-shrink seal.

Noticed few changes in packaging. It clearly says FOR EXPORT ONLY and they are printing India's FSSAI green mark on label in USA. Feels like its substandard product. Manufacturing exclusively for people of India. I dnt know whats wrong but its definitely not On's Gold standard Whey that we had earlier. Discarding it and switching to Rule 1 or wild whey",119
2726,Khagendra,Read It,4,19-Dec-19,"Brand is famous and doesn't need any review however it is bit costly because of it's popularity.Take it but with safety.1. Never take more than necessary protein because excess protein can damage kidney. Yes we believe if we take extra, we will be stronger however it has side effects and shoud be consumed in safe limit.2. When you take protein you must drink minimum 3 litres of water. Again drinking excess water helps kidney to flush out excess urea and also excess unconsumed protein.3. When you don't excercise, don't take it. Many guys keep consuming it even after they don't go to gym or workout. Don't take it as a health nutrition.4. When you visit any gym, the gym trainer try to brainwash you to buy protein powder. Never listen to the gym guy because he gets commision to sell protein powder. If you really need, get one. Also don't buy the brand suggested by gym trainer. To get high commission they suggest you any other brand and they don't care about your health. They just care about their commision.Thanks for reading. Cheers!",61

The manufacturing date should be of a difference of 2 years exactly .3. Check for any spelling mistakes4. Scan the QR code and make sure it leads to their original site .5. Inside the bottle , there will be a scoop and it should be in golden colour with the ON logo .6.

I will recommend to those who are doing workout, gyming or exercises and require high protein content for muscle building. If you can complete your required protein content by food like eggs, chicken breasts, etc then there is no need of this protein powder. Therefore don?? buy it blindly, firstly do analyse your body protein needs, workout goals and daily protein intake you are getting currently then go for it. No issues with the product and the brand as it is 100% genuine of Optimum Nutrition.",13
2735,Anurag,Good Quality Whey Protein,5,25-Jul-22,I purchased this product multiple times. Tast is ok for me. I check the authenticity code and packing after doing all the outer inspection its time to check the inside stuff. As we all know pure protein is not heat soluble so I would take some water in a cup put 1 to 2 teaspoon of the whey protein powder mix it and put it in the microwave for 2 mins. After two mins you will find the powder has turned into solid in indian language it will be like (fata hua dudh). We are set and ready to use the product tension free and focus on working out and putting extra effort.,2
2736,Antra Maurya,Changes in Authenticity check,4,10-Jan-22,So I watched a lot of YouTube videos regarding ON authenticity.My product did not have an importer tag also there was no blue expiry date on the bottom.So I called ON customer support and the agent mentioned below points-1.

Check if there is a hologram (golden colour) at the cap2. Look for the manufacturing details and batch code at the bottom of the bottle . It should be in blue colour . The manufacturing date should be of a difference of 2 years exactly .3. Check for any spelling mistakes4. Scan the QR code and make sure it leads to their original site .5. Inside the bottle , there will be a scoop and it should be in golden colour with the ON logo .6.

I will recommend to those who are doing workout, gyming or exercises and require high protein content for muscle building. If you can complete your required protein content by food like eggs, chicken breasts, etc then there is no need of this protein powder. Therefore don?? buy it blindly, firstly do analyse your body protein needs, workout goals and daily protein intake you are getting currently then go for it. No issues with the product and the brand as it is 100% genuine of Optimum Nutrition.",13
2745,Anurag,Good Quality Whey Protein,5,25-Jul-22,I purchased this product multiple times. Tast is ok for me. I check the authenticity code and packing after doing all the outer inspection its time to check the inside stuff. As we all know pure protein is not heat soluble so I would take some water in a cup put 1 to 2 teaspoon of the whey protein powder mix it and put it in the microwave for 2 mins. After two mins you will find the powder has turned into solid in indian language it will be like (fata hua dudh). We are set and ready to use the product tension free and focus on working out and putting extra effort.,2

I wonder what different procedure they did and it got authentication right as there are only 2 ways to do so ..I opened the jar and it had no seal in the inside to protect it from moisture ..I was not able to mix it well with the water ..The smell is something weird and also taste is something like a cough syrup nothing like a double chocolate..The consistency is too wattery after mixing.The 10 Days Return / Replacement is a total scam with this product , so don't believe what the tab below the product says! As you try to get it replaced or try to return it, they can only connect you to the Amazon customer care who in turn will ask  to mail and connect with the manufacturer.Overall not worth and a disappointment.

The bottle looks authentic but the powder inside was a little off. Maybe it got damaged in Indian weather conditions. Or maybe it?? Indian ON. I don?? know.

2758,Amazon Customer,Dissatisfied with the packaging.,3,13-Jul-20,"2lb. Rocky Road. My issue with this particular purchase was that the cap was not tightly shut, even though the seal was intact. Some powder leaked out. I could actually tighten the cap even without opening the seal. One thing I don't like about ON is that the tubs don't look premium and the seal system is inferior to the price we pay.About this purchase, I think it is genuine. I have checked the 6-digit code in the website. Moreover it looks, feels and tastes exactly like the ones I normally purchase in the UAE.About the flavor(Rocky Road), it is good, but I still think 'Double Rich Chocolate' and 'Chocolate Malt' are better.",2

I realise this as I switched to Dynamo and I could feel the difference in a week. So I have to give it has to do with the product as I have been regular in my schedule. I am not complaining about ON but about its authenticity. I am quite sure the product offered was a counterfeit product.

The expiry date for the box is June 2021. I did not check it prior to opening. Also it does not taste good (not like the previous ones I have had).

Never take more than necessary protein because excess protein can damage kidney. Yes we believe if we take extra, we will be stronger however it has side effects and shoud be consumed in safe limit.2. When you take protein you must drink minimum 3 litres of water. Again drinking excess water helps kidney to flush out excess urea and also excess unconsumed protein.3. When you don't excercise, don't take it. Many guys keep consuming it even after they don't go to gym or workout. Don't take it as a health nutrition.4. When you visit any gym, the gym trainer try to brainwash you to buy protein powder. Never listen to the gym guy because he gets commision to sell protein powder. If you really need, get one. Also don't buy the brand suggested by gym trainer. To get high commission they suggest you any other brand and they don't care about your health. They just care about their commision.Thanks for reading. Cheers!",61

The manufacturing date should be of a difference of 2 years exactly .3. Check for any spelling mistakes4. Scan the QR code and make sure it leads to their original site .5. Inside the bottle , there will be a scoop and it should be in golden colour with the ON logo .6.

There will be no importer tag in new ON boxes.3. Expiry date and batch number is now printed on back of the box in a white space with black ink and not on the bottom.4.No vaccum cover on the lid intead a pasted seal.5. Check authenticity by the TRU SEAL (which we all do).,3

2884,Amazon Customer,"May cause bloating, be aware",1,5-May-20,While it's rated to be a decent whey supplement but it may cause bloating especially for people who may not have a very strong digestive system which people usually don't. So be aware of that before buying this. Have bought it used it twice or thrice but now it's practically waste for me as I wont be consuming it considering it causes bloating every time,8
2885,Amazon Customer,Bottle was half fulled. Cheating to customers,1,23-Oct-18,When i opened the cap seal was not there and the bottle was half filled. The required quantity was not there. Do not buy the product online here.,15

2888,Amazon Customer,Good but only recommended for coffee drinkers,4,19-Nov-18,"So I ordered the mocha cappuccino flavour. The taste is 7/10 and the mixability is 9/10 since I use a shaker bottle. However this particular flavour contains actual coffee, so if you're not a regular coffee drinker and have low caffeine tolerance like me, you're gonna feel the effects of coffee when you drink this. For instance, when I had this in the evenings, I couldn't fall asleep at night. So if you're gonna go ahead and buy this, make sure you're ok with this or you're a  regular coffee drinker and have high tolerance.",8

I discussed with Amazon representative on this, I requested him for replacement. He said that on site itself it was mentioned that protien will expire by May 2021. But it was not written that it would be 1.5 years older.  So no replacement.. :(So guys please be careful before you order it.",3

I never a multinational brand like Amazon to deliver this type of product. It impacts the brand image of the company.,4
2891,SHREDDER,Amazing product. Love it!!!,5,15-Oct-18,"Thanks Cloudtail & Amazon for giving this genuine product. It's very hard to buy orignal protein supplements online, as you will never know till you get it. This is fully authentic as it has a scratch code which can be validated on the link for authenticity. I have been using it for quite some time and the protein just works wonders. A must buy for anyone who needs a pure protein addition in diet. Great for increasing muscle mass and reducing fat if taken properly with regular exercise.",6

2893,Akshay Patel,Not mixing well,1,9-Mar-22,"On the product, it says that Stir, shake, or blend until dissolved. But the product isn't dissolving at all. There are lumps left on the top which are not able to dissolve. Additional, there is some kind of layer of form after mixing with milk (mixing with water also has only a little layer of form and will taste like hell, will not be able to drink that). I don't know whether it is an original product or duplicate (yes, I checked on that website and it says Authentic Product but can't believe that).",1

2895,George,"Scoop is different, not Golden .flavor rocky roads",2,14-Jul-21,"Product seems genuine. The only worry was the scoop is a transparent scoop with no logo on it. People who use Opitimum will be aware of the Golden scoop with Logo. I authenticated the product on Optimum website as well as had a call with the customer care- they told me due to environmental concerns the plastic  for the scoop is now transparent. Doesn't make sense at all? Taste wise is Ok.. flavours can be same as the actual rocky road, nor do other flavours except for the generic onces i.e vanilla, chocolate etc. Giving it 2 stars as of now, because of the scoop and the explanation given to me.",1
2896,Amazon Customer,"Product was tampered, Pls take this seriously",1,30-Jul-22,Bottom of the container was tampered.

3276,Nitish Negi,A very well presented FAKE powder,1,19-Jul-18,"Well this is a very well done FAKE product.Now you guys must be wondering that how am I this sure about the quality of the product.So here it goes.I have been consuming this product from the last 1 year. And every time I have asked my known ones to get it from any GNC store in USA.So from the beginning I have consumed the genuine product.And now comes the interesting part. Why I am sure that this product is not Genuine.So the one I ordered from here was sweet like a chocolate powder that is used to make chocolate shake. The original GNC one I ordered was not sweet at all. It tasted all bland. Moreover the Sugar Content in the ingredients of the packing is 1gram per serving. Low enough that you just won't taste it. Just as in case of the GNC one.Also, when I first opened the jar, there were a hell lot of white particles all around the powder that were not mixed. I never saw anything like this in my previous protein of same make and type.Checkout the image I have attached.Another one was the powder seemed to be as if moisture has had its effect on it. The one I consumed from GNC was just like ""Maida"" with not moisture.Now at last, this is a very well presented fake product.Think I am just defaming it? Go ahead! Buy it.I don't care if you still want to have it.But would love to at least speak it out and help someone who isn't aware of such things.Peace!EDIT: Tried placing a replacement order just to see if I accidentally received the fake one. But to my surprise, it was 'MORE FAKE' than the previous one. This time, not only the powder but the whole packaging was copied and was fake. There was ""S"" missing in the ""ISOLATES"" in from on the box. Also, there was a difference in the design of the label.Have placed a return now.",12
3277,Swapnil,Amazon Be ready for my next order in next month ;),5,9-Jan-18,"Thank you very much,Cloudtail for selling productAmazon for making it available and good customer support ""When I contact them for asking what if I get a fake product what will happen they said it's not eligible for return but if I received fake they will provide full support to me""But at the end I received genuine product: )Just I have one question (which I asked in question section so please answer it)Double chocolate taste like a little bit medicine like sweetner not like natural sweet sugar may be that's because there is artificial sugar in product: :) don't know 1st time buying it.I done following checks:-1.Container shape2.Dhakan shining :D3.spelling mistakesImportant: -4.Golden seal on neck5.Barcode on tub leading to Optimum nutrition site6.Barcode on ""bright commodities"" sticker leading to authentication process7.Scratching on ""Bright commodities"" sticker to get a code to put on official ""Bright commodities"" site for authentication8.Hole if someone try to remove original power and replace it with fakeFollowing things final things telling you quality of product: -9.Smell10.Mixing with water (yes if you kept it still particles at top will try to come together)And do mixing in glass mug so that you can see if particles are settling down (doesn't settle in case of original when check after 7-8 sec)11. Doesn't taste exactly like natural sugar sweet but something similar to sweetners.May be I put a lot of waterSo yeah thats all.Edit:- Ordered 2nd time :)This time I did a replacement because I was not satisfied with the quality of my first order and Amazon was really helpful in that.Amazon Be ready for my next order in next month.Edit:- Ordered 3rd time Double rich chocolate flavor is got dull I'll some new flavour next time may be Mocha Cappuccino :)Yeah and this time packaging was damaged  there was big whole in it but fortunately my product was safe.Amazon Be ready for my next order in next month.Edit:- Now this is my last edit,I tried Mocha cappuccino, Double rich chocolate, Extreme Milk Chocolate flavours and believe me, Mocha cappuccino is the only best flavour for me :).

3280,Shubhadeep Mukhopadhyay,TAKE TIME & READ THE WHOLE REVIEW THOROUGHLY. I hope you will find every tiny detail that you want/need in this review.,4,21-Mar-18,"I WILL GIVE THE FULL REVIEW POINT BY POINT (with attached Photos). ENJOY AND KEEP READING, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.Just to clarify and to be honest, this is the first time I'm using a Whey protein, not just the brand but Whey protein itself. Though, I was very skeptical about the purchase after reading so many reviews about the product being fake, I still decided to order it.ABOUT THE JAR/TUB (AUTHENTICITY CHECK from the outside): There was a strong chocolate smell on the outside of the jar already. I checked the bottom of the jar and the tub looked normal. Mfd and Exp date had exactly 2 years gap. I did not find any tampering marks whatsoever.There was the ""ON Authentic seal"" on the neck band. I checked everything thoroughly before opening it. The QR code on the jar itself led me to product page of Optimum Nutrition website.The QR code on the importer sticker led me to Bright Commodities authenticity checking page. I scratched the Importer sticker for the hidden code and entered all the details and it said that the product is authentic.After opening the jar, I did find the seal attached on the lid.The jar was kind of half filled, not up to the brim. (Doubt 1)I also found the golden scoop with the branding on it and Made in USA written inside the scoop along with some other details.SMELL, CONSISTENCY AND TEXTURE OF THE POWDER: The power smelled nice and the texture was normal I think (First time user), not clumpy or anything.No stickiness at all, the powder did not stick to the inside of the jar. (Authenticity checking method found somewhere online)One thing that I noticed was that, the powder had some white particles in it. (Doubt 2)Now, to clear out my doubts I called 011-49594959 which was Glanbia Performance Nutrition. I followed the instructions given by the IVR and asked about my doubts. The customer executive was helpful enough and told that ""The product is 100% authentic. The jar is supposed to be filled half way and the white particles are 'Amino Acids'.""I was satisfied with all the authenticity checking and all.TASTE: Though it smelled really chocolaty, the taste was just okay. According to me, it had a medicinal taste to it.Consistency was okay, not thick at all, it might just be the amount of water I added. (1 full scoop in one glass of water)MIXABILITY: It mixed with the water fairly easily. Found 1 tiny lump, and by ""tiny"" I really mean tiny, most of the people won't even notice it probably. I noticed it because I was trying to find lumps intentionally. Now, keep in mind that I did not use a shaker, it was simply stirred with a spoon in a glass. I did not even stir vigorously. So, mixability is good I think.RATING: Now, talking about the rating, I gave it a 4* just because the taste was okay.",14
3281,Amrut,FULL REVIEW,5,9-Oct-17,"First of all would like to appreciate amazon for the fast delivery, cuz I got the product in 1 day of ordering.I was worried after seeing the reviews that my whey could turn out to be fake and I will regret buying from Amazon but it turned out to be genuine and although the Amazon seller was Cloudtailindia the product is indeed imported by Bright commodities which is the official importer of ON in india. To check the authenticity of the whey always watch videos on YouTube regarding ""how to identify fake ON whey from original one's"" before buying so that you can check it quickly once it arrives.Make sure on the day of the delivery you install a QR and barcode scanner app on your smartphone to quickly scan the codes on the tub which will take you to the official ON Website. As of the whey itself I'm completely relieved because it genuine and it's a trusted and no. 1 brand through the decade.i'd ordered double rich choc.My review on the product :1)TASTE - 8/102)MIXABILITY - 9/10 (always mix w/ cold water/milk)3)QUALITY - 10/104) EFFICIENCY* - 9/10..*efficiency could relate from person to person since it's based on many factors such as age, workout intensity,diet, dedication etc.dont expect to build a muscular body without working out hardcore in the gym and maintaining a healthy diet of egg whites,chicken,veggies and protein shake(remember it's a supplement not a whole food)THANK YOU.if any doubts feel free to dm me on Insta - amrut_p49",12

Had the best experience today with rocky road, which reminded me to write a review. IT IS FREAKING YUMMIEEEEE. Now you see I'm not a sweet tooth. Sweet or no sweet i like. But this.. this is osm. one among the best. Heard "" MILKY CHOCOLATE "" is like 20 times better than rocky road! o.O REALLY? well to find that out, I did a Evil deed by suggesting it to my friend, his product is about to arrive, will have a sip of it and let you know about that taste too. ;)I take my protien with coconut water - Review - Sweet, Refreshing, and Yumiee.I take my protien with plain water - Review - Little Bland, Yummie.

3286,Rajiv Pillai,Great to taste with a promising nutrition,4,14-May-14,"For a first timer, I must admit that the taste of Double Chocolate is definitely good. It's too early and too little to comment about the health benefits but hopefully it should be great as well. The only drawback as compared to Nutrilite Protein Powder, is that this isn't a family protein powder. You can't give it to children below 18 who need protein equally well.",1

3294,Amazon Customer,It seems to be a FAKE product,1,3-Dec-16,"If you visit Optimum Nutrition official website to check the genuineness of their product, there are several tests that they recommend. And the product which I received didn't passed those tests.1. There is absolutely no seal, which is completely is contrast to what the website said. Product is readily available to rotate the cap anticlockwise and use. It's just like every other home container.2. The hologram is sticker on above the cap. Not in proper place.3. Container's bottom is not matching the description that's stated on official website.I've performed these tests only on packaging and container and it looks fake that way. However, I haven't used any sort of protein before so I'm clueless how to test the actual product.N.B.: I'm only doubting the genuineness of this product by looking at the packaging because it doesn't match the one described on the official website. However if that's how its supposed to be, than its also possible that it may be a genuine product.",3
3295,JYOTHISH C V,ORGINAL PRODUCT,5,7-Jan-18,"I have been using whey protien of different companies for years including that of Optimum Nutrition,bought ON whey protien from amazon for last six months and almost certain about its genuinty as it ia as same as i used to take in Dubai.  Mixtureblity/texture wise ON protien is way ahead of other brands.  Friends about effectiveness it will take time to show of as unlike creatine and pre-workout amplifiers there is no immediate noticeable effect.  I strongly believe whey protien supplementation must be used in place of an unhealthy meal,which would be very important for an individual seeking an improved physique, whey protien and oats is an excellent unhealthy meal replacement for we indians.  Iam unable to find any negatives associated with optimum nutrition whey protien powder.

The mfg date and exp date was printed below the tub in blue ink and were exactly 2 years apart.",2
3313,PP,Not sure about Authenticity of the product,1,9-Oct-17,"Bad packing, box damaged when I received it. The bar code has 2 stickers on top of each other,  so effectively there are 3 bar codes, one printed on the box and other 2 stuck on the original one. I tried reading the top most but the bar code was NOT FOUND. Then I peeled off the top most bar code and tested the one printed on the bottle and it took me to the ON website. I don't understand why they have 3 bar codes and only one was read by the machine.The whey pounder has some white color material in it.The packing and the seal was not proper and it is safe to say that I was damaged.Not sure if Amazon is selling original ON products. The lid of the bottle opened without removing the seal. Funny!And even some whey pounder came out, though it was very little, it means that may not have been vacuum packed which suggests tampering.Not happy.",2

But, I'm not very happy with the product because of the following reasons.1. When I opened the lid, there was no seal pack at the top of the jar. Usualy even indian brands have the sealed air tight bottle opening.2. The moment I opened the Jar, a gush of stink entered  my nose. Although it lasted only Few seconds, but there it was.3. It does not dissplve easily. Even after shaking few times, few chunks of the protein remain undissolved.I never faced any of these problems in any of the indian brands. So I'm very very much disappointed. Even after paying so much if we can't get excellent quality, then what's the point of spending so much money on the brand.",1

And it actually opened without removing the seal so I was obviously tensed. Then I thought lets it give a try may be its not fake.

This isn?? a guess work. I had both in front of me. The taste too was a bit different. I am not able to point out exactly how. Now I had been taking This for last three days and soon after consuming it I start feeling gaseous and rumbling in the stomach. Since yesterday I have developed loose motion.

It is not flat. It is generally curved in.3 - The number of servings depend on tub size and flavor i.e. For the 5lbs the number of servings should be 74. Not 24.You can check this on their official website for the number of servings if you don't want to believe me.I wasted my 3 thousand on this. Please don't waste yours. Try healthkart instead.

3499,Atul Kumar Singh,Please read this before/after you buy - to authenticate your product,5,11-Mar-19,"If you??e planning to purchase this product, I request you to please read this review and key pointers for gauging product authenticity. I?? writing this review as many of other reviews are passing off even genuine products as fake owing to limited/wrong information.Before I go further, let me tell you that Optimum Nutrition (ON) Whey Protein is one of the best and most trusted products in the market and is used extensively by people hitting the gym. Hence, you don?? need to doubt the product itself, since it has proven its worth over time.When you first receive the product, Please make sure to take pictures of the box from all sides. Take zoom in picture of the Expiry Date / Batch Number. The simplest way to check for authenticity of the product is to mail the pictures to Optimum Nutrition Customer Care [Please visit the official site for contact details] on their USA customer care as well as India specific customer care (both available on official website). They work from 9AM to 5PM USA time, Monday to Friday, so don?? expect a response outside of this time. Also, please reduce the size of each image or else the server will reject the message due to large size. My first message with an attachment of 18MB was rejected by the server and I had to send it again. You need to mention below details while messaging the customer care -- Product Name- Size- Flavour- Name of the place of purchase and location (address or URL)- Country where you purchased- Seller Name or Item identification number (if purchased from an online marketplace)- Lot Number- Expiration Date- Last 5 Digits of Bar Code- Pictures of Batch Number / Exp Date / Mfd Date- Pictures of Front and back of the canister / Importer Label / Bar Codes / Invoice CopyCustomer Care should revert within 1-2 business days with details on whether product is authentic or not. In my case, they reverted within 2 days.The second step is to check for product authenticity through Bright Commodities site (if your product has been imported by Bright Commodities). Please check the box, there would be a label with importer details, a QR Code and a Scratch box on top. Scratch this box to reveal your unique product code. Now use a QR Code scanner through a smartphone, and you would land on bright commodities site, and you need to fill out a small form, and submit this unique code. On Submit, it will tell you if the product is genuine or not. In case of genuine products, it??l show: ??ongratulations. Your product is genuine.??This is sure shot way to verify if your product is genuine or not.Now, coming to ON certified methods of checking product authenticity. ON website mentions just 4 things to check if the product is authentic or not:1. NECK BAND ??Gold Standard whey protein has a black plastic neckband and a gold hologram seal. This seal is part of the neckband itself and is NOT a separate sticker. On tilting, you would see colorful ??N??written within the seal.2. TUB DESIGN - The crease on the bottom of U.S. made tubs of protein is a mold mark from plastic thermoforming. It looks the same on every tub and is normal. However, please note, Tubs produced in the U.K. have a circular indentation without a line running across the bottom. This is normal for European made tubs.3. DATE & BATCH CODE - On the BOTTOM or SIDE of protein tubs you??l find ink jet printing listing a manufacture date, expiration date and batch code. Powdered products have a 2-year shelf life, so the dates should be 2 years apart. This date is printed usually in Blue (mostly) or yellow color. Also, if you rub over it too much, it??l be removed.4. VACUUM BARRIERS - Under the cap of protein tubs is a cardboard vacuum barrier that helps hold the powder in place during shipping. This round disk is not for sanitation and is not glued into place. It is common for the cardboard to stick under the cap. So, using a knife or any sharp thin thing, you can remove this white colored cap. Underneath (on the plastic cover of the box), you will see ??ade in USA??if the product is manufactured in the USA.Some other pointers to safeguard against duplicate product -1. Powder Texture ??Gold Standard whey protein powder texture is such that it doesn?? stick to the insides of the box. When you open the box, powder should not be sticking to the side walls of the box. [See attached pictures of how it should look]2. Mixing - Gold Standard whey protein powder readily mixes with water without forming any lumps. If your product is forming lumps even after a lot of mixing and shaking, it is a fake product.3. Powder Scoop ??Every box comes with one scoop inside, which would have ON branding and would be of Golden color. Even the scoop mentions ??ade in USA??[Please check attached pictures]4. Black Neck Band would be glossy/shiny in textureBUSTING SOME MYTHS & WRONG INFORMATION. Below points DO NOT make your product fake.1. The black band does not have ??reat taste, new improved etc??printed all over like shown on the official website?? product authentication page.ON website doesn?? mention anything about printed neck bands, it simply mentions black plastic neckband. Even on ON official website, on the product page, it shows the box with a simple black band. Even biggest USA retailer websites, they would show product with a simple black band. Hence, please don?? get misguided by some other reviews where they proclaimed a product to be fake based on this point. My product has been verified as 100% authentic by the company, you can see the pictures.2. Box mentions ??SOLATE??instead of ??SOLATES??Across ON official website, you would see products with ??solate??mentioned (See various sections like 10lb product image, recipe images etc). Top US retailers show the same imagery with ??solate??mentioned instead of ??solates?? My product was verified as authentic by the company, it mentions ??solate??3. There is no QR Code on my box, and only importer QR code is shown.These products are manufactured especially for export for certain markets. For example, products imported by bright commodities are specially manufactured to be exported to India, hence you would even see ??SSAI??mentioned near the box bar code whereas FSSAI is an Indian standard. My product has been verified by the company itself, there?? no QR code as it?? for Export only, and you can see the pictures.4. Box shows green Veg symbol and there is no such concept in the US.These products are manufactured especially for export purpose and hence follow the standards of the destination country.5. Nutrition information is quite shorter and less informative, while on official web picture it is mentioned as ??utrition Facts??and more descriptive.No, this does not make your product fake. These products are manufactured especially for export for certain markets such as India. The company is following the standards as per Indian market and as per laws laid down by the Indian government, regarding ??utrition Information?? Pick any consumable product being sold in India, as per rule, ??utrition Information??needs to be mentioned as opposed to the USA, where ??utrition Facts??terminology is being used. This is the same reason why on these products, weight is mentioned in ??/Kg??before being mentioned in ??bs??6. My box is not completely filled with protein powder.Whey protein is sold by weight not volume, and the box is usually larger than the contents it is supposed to hold. It will roughly cover 65-75% volume of the box and would never be completely filled.That?? all friends. I hope now you would be in a better state to confirm if your product is genuine or fake. I hope I was able to help you out. When I was buying this product for the first time, I was equally confused. However, with above-mentioned points you can safeguard yourself against duplicate products. Thanks a lot.",12

3540,Amazon Customer,The Product is Authentic: Verified the barcode.,5,13-Jun-17,"First off, the product was delivered on time, the delivery person was very polite and pleasant which was nice.The product is genuine, the first thing i did was scan the barcode and was happy to see that it was authentic. Secondly, something that everyone has qualms and questions about, is taste. How does this thing taste? The answer: It tastes good, basically like chocolate milk to put it in simple terms. This isn't a milkshake, so if your drooling over the fact that its ""double chocolate ooo lala slurp slurp"", go get yourself one, this is a protein supplement, the key purpose of which is not to taste good. No it is not chalky, no it has no chemical taste or artificial taste.I did extensive research on the product before getting it, it is one of the safest and most genuine protein supplements out there, except that, yes, it does contain artificial sweetener, which is one con, perhaps a big one for some of you, but other than that i have read excellent reviews on the product. One thing that i can say is, ON whey alone will not get your muscles growing like they're on steroids. A lot of whackos on here complaining about how the product isn't genuine because they aren't seeing results. I'll give it to you plain and simple. Your diet plays a much much bigger role in your muscle growth and definition and overall performance, not the supplement. The supplement does 10% of the work, 20% of the work is you working out hard, the rest which is 70% is a good balanced diet, good sleep, and overall good lifestyle. SO if you expect Whey ON to make your biceps pop like popeye, and whine if it doesn't, your probably too immature to be taking protein.",10

Well talking about the flavour that it has More than 18 different flavours than any other whey protein manufacturer has.For better results take it immediately after your workout and try to take minimum 2 to 3 scoops daily as i take 1 scoop one hour later in morning after breakfast mixed with yoghurt and 1.5 scoop after workout in evening but keep in mind don't eat for 1 hour after consuming it let it get digested and then take your meals otherwise you are wasting your whey protein.Tips to find the product is genuine or not1. Lot Number : Every optimum nutrition product has a lot number which signifies that it belongs to the original ON product batch. This number can be found on the bottom of the jar.2. MFG and Expiry Date : Always check manufacturing date and expiry date. An expired product is of no use because it can give you serious side effects.3. Product Label : ON Gold Standard 100% Whey?? product label is printed with dark and vibrant colors with a shiny and smooth finish. You should check the label thoroughly, it should not look flimsy. It also lists 24g WPI, 5.5g BCAAs and 4g Glutamine. You should check that this info is correct on your label.4. Grammatical Errors : There is no room for grammatical errors on Optimum Nutrition?? product label. If you find any errors on the product label then it is fake.5. Check Seal : The container should be sealed properly from outside especially the lid is properly sealed if ON Gold 100 Whey is genuine. The seal is shiny and also the lead. Do not accept if there is no seal.6. Check Manufacturer?? Address : All ON products are mostly manufactured in the USA, so your Whey protein container should have the USA manufactures address. Check the back of the container.7. Scan The Bar Code : On the jar you will find a QR code and a bar code. Just scan these codes with your smartphone by using a QR code scanning app. It will show you product details. If the details come to be about ON Gold Standard 100% Whey then its genuine otherwise fake.#Flavours are rated above.??Extereme milk chocolate 10/10??Double rich chocolate. 9/10??Chocolate mint 8/10??Vanila ice cream. 8/10??Rocky road. 7/10??Mocha cappuccino. 10/10???Birthday cake. 7/10??Although my favourite is mocha cappuccino and extreme milk chocolate but mostly i take mocha cappuccino Because it taste little bit like coffee and i take it in cold low fat milk that's why it taste like cold coffee.So guys i think you will find this helpful.??This time the packaging was worse the jar was damaged but it is genuine. But This does not happen all the time. ??",2

3567,Joshua S.,HONEST TRUE REVIEW!!!,5,7-Oct-19,"Whey protein isolate is the best form of protein to be directly absorbed into your body in the form of a liquid.Optimum nutrition gold standard hands on is the best supplement company available in the market, whatever the price may be, it assures and delivers quality protein supplements.For beginners take it slow and don?? rush to 1 scoop directly, have like a quarter a day, then after a few days go for half a scoop because your body needs to adjust to these supplements as you may get loose motions and runny stools if not consumed properly.Some of the cases are1) if you??e new and completely take 1 scoop and your body doesn?? adjust to it.2) if you consume whey on an empty stomach early morning without anything to eat and if you??e really hungry3) directly consumed whey and you go to sleepSo the best time is after your workout drink it with chilled milk as milk gives you added proteins.But remember whey is a supplement like any other who doesn?? have time to prepare 1 major meal and needs a substitute for that.Whey proteins are a fast absorbing substance and hence to process it is expensive as it has to go through numerous processes( can?? explain it in detail), hence the finished product is also expensive, but it delivers results.This cookie and cream flavour is really good I?? rate it a 4/5The absorbency I?? rate it a 3.8/5And it?? truly a genuine product.Suggestion, have a couple of bananas, oats, boiled chicken breast, peanut butter for better results.",1

3571,Sahil,ON Whey Protein Gold Standard Review,3,5-May-20,Genuine product. Verified via authentication code.Tastes not so good. Packaging was good. Sealed pack.The container had all the information and was in very good condition. ON seal on cap. ON golden scoop inside.Smell is fine. Too thick when mixed with water. A little heavy to drink. Taste makes it difficult to drink with the overall thickness of the shake.,1

3582,Amazon_Shopper,Best whey protein on earth. Tips to find out the fake ones.,5,25-Mar-17,"First of all I didn't buy this whey protein from Amazon. I bought it from authorized neulife store. Double Rich Chocolate is the best flavor of ON 100% Whey and has a mouth watering taste even with water. Milk gives more rich taste and you will feel that you just have eaten a double chocolate drink. Its taste is awesome.Now I am here to tell you guys about spotting the fake ON Whey protein and also I will address some misconceptions about this product which are unnecessarily degrading its value.Tips to check the genuine ON Whey1. First of all if you are worried about the genuinity then I would suggest you buy ON protein only from three sources. These three sources are neulife online store (neulife online store), neulife retail store, and finally Cloudtail India on Amazon. There is no doubt that neulife is the oldest importer of ON products in India so you can buy from them with confidence. I contacted Glanbia India customer care and they have confirmed this that neulife directly imports ON products from Glanbia and they also said that Cloudtail India is also their trusted ON whey seller. If you are buying from Cloudtail and getting ON Whey with a 'Bright commodities' sticker then it's all genuine.2. Neulife has a better system of verifying their ON Whey products. Every neulife ON Whey product has a unique code, QR code that you have to scan or SMS to neulife to verify it. I instantly got a message that ""My ON whey is genuine"". You can only verify it once though.3. The double rich chocolate flavor is awesome and when you mix it with water it forms a white creamy layer and taste if awesome exactly like double rich chocolate.4. If you are mixing one scoop with little water then it will the real chocolate taste with very very little bitterness exactly like a dark chocolate. It is sweet also. The bitterness is sometimes unnoticeable, this bitterness feels exactly the same on tongue after eating a dark chocolate.5. DRC flavor smells like chocolate and have tiny white in it.6. Comes with golden seal which is printed on the black label.Misconceptions:Some people say that they are getting fake supplements and half of the powder is fake. Some also say that the sellers cut the container from the bottom and remove the original powder and fill it with some fake powder. But I checked my container from inside after emptying it and found that the bottom is intact from inside and no sign of cutting the container was found. Please check attached images for clarification.But if you buy from neulife then there is no problem. Cloudtail India sells genuine ON whey as confirmed by Glanbia Performance Nutrition, but I can't say about the delivery agents. Buying supplements online are also not good in summers as these supplements need cool places to store while during transit the whey powder go though heat which may degrade its quality.If you are going to GYM then stay away from trainer's advice over this and never buy even if he gives you heavy discounts. This gym trainers will never give you the protein imported legally, they will either sell you grey market stuff which is mostly fake or they sell you supplements that are imported from unknown sources. Stay away from these fake trainers if you love your body.I was shocked to know that my GYM trainer doesn't know about neulife.So buy your protein from neulife or cloudtail only. Also stay away from low quality supplements like MuscleBlaze, don't get fooled in the name of made in India whey protein. ON is the best whey protein in the world. It is light on stomach and won't give you headaches or stomach pain. It is digested easily and helps in muscle building.Attached images for more info.",28
3583,Abbas Shirazi,The caffeine content per scoop is very proportional to the protein per scoop we get.,4,7-Oct-19,"Firstly, i would rate this particular product 9/10 as compared to other whey proteins of ON.This mocha cappuccino tastes fantastic, I liked it a lot. It is far better than the chocolate flavored.The mixiblity is same as other wheys.It blends as well.Overall, it is best suitable for beginners and intermediate body builders.",1

Do they even know IT DOES NOT come with inner seal and serving depends on flavor they choose...Just to clarify... I bought this from Nulife,... The container has an outside seal with ON authentic hologram, once you remove that seal, there will be no inner seal, so don't worry and enjoy the product... I thought I will clarify this as many people are thinking it is fake due to non presence of inner seal... If the Seal is tampered or broken it is then advisable to return the product...Also to add on, servings depend on flavors, each flavor might have different servings so do not again assume that you got fake product... Thanks, Mannan",1

3604,Ashish Prasad .com,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard - One of the Best Whey Protein Blends,5,7-Mar-16,"--------------------------------------UPDATE 11 March 2016---------------------------------------I keep an eye on my reviews but lately, I have seen this happening often . I get a few votes up for a review  and then quite strangely  a down vote the same day, that really has left me wondering if some people are deliberately down voting reviews. I don't understand how Amazon moderators are letting this off.---------------------------------------------I am compelled to write this review after seeing quite a few negative reviews calling it a fake or counterfeit which I find it quite misleading once again. I bought the 1lb pack to check the concerns raised that the packaging is mislabeled with a 23gram protein scoop. To all the concerned people, there is in fact 1lb Gold Standard refill pack with 24g protein per scoop. (Photos attached)
Optimum Nutrition (ON) 100% Whey Gold Standard - 2 lbs (Double Rich Chocolate)
?is one of the best Whey proteins in the market today. Three things I liked about this product, the manufacturing is entirely done in the USA following strict US regulations, the grams of protein in each scoop and the taste.If you??e new to Protein Supplements, this is a quick overview of few major protein types that are sold in the market today.Most protein supplements that are in the market offer blends of different types of whey proteins. To make it easy, let me break it down for you. There are three types of fast digestive proteins, the cheapest is the Whey Concentrate typically a mass gainer with lots of carbs , then comes the more expensive Whey Isolate and then the most expensive Whey Hydro Isolate .Concentrate typically takes about 2-3 hours to digest, Isolates can be digested in your system within 2 hours, Hydro Isolates is purest form whey and can be taken even if you??e lactose intolerant - Hydro isolates can be digested within an hour and work best as Post Workout drinks. Basically, the price of your protein directly depends on the % of Whey Isolate or Whey Hydro Isolate present. There is also a slow digestive protein called Casein which is cheaper or almost the same as Whey Concentrate, treat this as a bedtime supplement as it takes about 6 hours to digest.What is OPTIMUM NUTRITION- 100% Whey Gold Standard ?ON 100% Whey Gold Standard is a multi-whey blend comprising isolates & concentrates as its main ingredients. It contains 24 grams of protein per serving, with a bit of fat, cholesterol, and lactose. Bear in mind, if you??e lactose intolerant, this is not for you unfortunately.Taste, Texture and MixabilityIt is not very sweet and mixes well with water and milk. I didn?? feel bloated and Double Chocolate flavour I??e tried was good, and I will give8.5/10 for the taste9.5/10 for mixabilityTotal score 9/10When will I start seeing results?This is the bitter truth, Protein supplements would help you <20% to reach your fitness goals. Your everyday workout helps you about another 30% and the rest is your daily diet as to how you maintain yourself eating healthy. You??e not going to get fitter staying home and just having 3 protein smoothies a day.From somewhere I had once read, you don?? buy protein protein supplements till you are regular at the gym working out and eating healthy for at least 90 days. Once those two habits are accomplished, buy protein supplements, and you will see results.Are protein supplements necessary?This question is debatable but it all comes down to how much protein is in your everyday diet. If you??e enough protein in your diet, no need obviously. From a personal perspective, I would avoid processed food like protein supplements any day, if I can consume enough protein through my diet (egg, milk, meat etc)Health Benefits/ IssuesIt is always advisable to take protein in their natural form (Milk, Egg, Meat, etc), but with a vegetarian diet that could be challenging. Rule of thumb with supplements is DO NOT go overboard - DO NOT take more than 2 scoops in 24 hours, but personally, if you??e not aiming for the Olympics, I suggest to start with 1 scoop a day so that you go easy on your body. In addition, you MUST drink a lot of water when taking protein supplements. From a lecture of Dr Tara Swart of MIT Sloan, your body requires 500ml of water for every 30lb (13.6 Kg) of your weight in a day to function normally.Smoothie recipe = 1 scoop (Chocolate) + 1 Avacado + Banana + 200ml Almond Milk + Ice Cubes in a Blender .PLEASE NOTE: Insufficient water intake can give you Stomach pain/ Abdominal Pain with protein supplements. NOT to be considered professional/medical advice. This review is based on personal experience. Protein supplements are to be considered with caution.",195

3607,Prime Customer,Use common sense,2,17-Aug-17,"You dont need supplements to build muscle.Because for body weight of 76kg you need nearly 150g of protein.And whey protein gives 24g for 1scoop so if 2lb is around Rs.3000 each scoop costs Rs.100 and you are still at deficit of neatly 135g.Chicken is even better a kilo costs Rs 130 and boneless breasts costs Rs. 200 and 100gm of the same costs Rs 20 and gives 31g of protein and 1gm fat. So having twice gives you 61gm of protein and costs Rs. 40 and with milk, eggs & oats, roti/chapati & rajma/channa/chole gives you full protein daily requirement all totalling under Rs. 100.So it makes no sense to buy supplements. Its like this as if you drinking horlicks makes you taller stronger and sharper and you've been drinking it since your childhood and you know the results.I am not saying taking supplements wont build muscles it does actually. But it makes no difference if you take chicken or egg or whey protein or milk. Protein is protein.All that matters is meeting your daily protein requirement of nealy 1.5 or 2gm of protein / kg of body weight and incase you are deficit in your daily requirement of say 25g you supplement it with supplements hence the name supplements ie you complete your deficit gap by supplementing it with shakes.And it makes no sense to make it as primary protein food and drink 6 scoops to meet such requirement spend Rs.10000 a month when normal food costs under Rs. 1500 and meets all your requirement.People in US usually take 2 scoops not because whey protein builds more muscle but because a pound of chicken or ~450g costs 6-8 dollars which can make up for 2 or 3 servings or one to one and half days so for a month it costs them considering $7 as average it costs $210. So in US whey protein is cheaper but in india chicken is cheaper.Its all consumerism they want you to buy so that they can make money.WRT preworkout creatine it makes no difference its just placebo effect. Ive used it for 2 years. Your strength grows naturally over time with or without creatine just eat proper normal food. And there is no better pre workout than a banana/rice",11
