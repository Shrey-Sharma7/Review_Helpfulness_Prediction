0,Rakesh Swain,First drink first impressions,5.0,9 September 2021,Update : After a 1.5 months of usage. Loving it. Does the job. Ordering it again. Though it has increased the price by 100 bucks. Inflation everywhere!______________________________________________Checked my orders. Had ordered ​Whey Energy Choclate for the last 10 times. So thought for a change of flavor and some extra protein.Pros:1.  Mango flavour is not as good as the choclate I was used to but good enough when mixed with milk. May be I need to give it time.2. The biggest pro over whey energy choclate is the absorbency. Mixes so well with chilled milk with same amount of shaking. Didn't find a single lump.3. Extra protein per scoop. I drink half before and half after workout. Good energy during workout and good recovery post workout.4. Unique scoop mechanism.5. No bloating or indigestion of any sort even though some extra protein. I mix 1 scoop with 500ml of chilled milk.Cons :1. Nothing as of now except may be a bit pricey I guess.,151
1,Misbah,Best ever protien,5.0,5 August 2021,I have used this protien since 10 days and I can say that it's good protien it's taste is awesome also it digests quickly I have used almost all imported brands but this one is nest level better than asitis better than bigmuscle better than imported brands go for it but price is little bit costly on whey protien and biozyme whey isolate is very costly than imported brands I will recommend U only Biozyme performance whey coz it's in budget range but if u want to buy biozyme whey protien and biozyme whey isolate then please don't buy these two because imported brand price and these two price are almost same go only for biozyme performance whey,125
2,Monu Banerjee,The Best Whey For Indian,5.0,21 August 2021,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I tried lots of variety in whey protein,but this protein is a one step upper then all other indian brand.I have been using MB Whey for a long time.And The result is great and if u use this whey or any MB product ,then u feel the rusult in one week.. and the best part of MuscleBlaze all information are clearly mention in product packaging..and one more best thing if you buy in amazon d'not worry about authentication bcoz MuscleBlaze all product are the sell form official MuscleBlaze company...just one suggestion for MuscleBlaze plz sand a gift as a shaker or t-shart...if you search any Indian brands so you go with MuscleBlaze..",127
3,Nirav d.,Best flavour i have ever tested & tasted till date,5.0,28 May 2021,I have tried bunch of flavours but ordered this Mango flavour for the first time & believe me this is the best flavour i have ever tasted & just try with milk & you're gonna love it ...Just buy it,104
4,Vinuth,Just go for a change,4.0,12 June 2021,"Generally for protein shakes, it's better to go with flavours that go well with milk. You can choose flavours like grape, strawberry and mango just for a change.But the problem is the flavour is too sweet and I felt like mango sugar taste and for slow absorption if you take it with milk then you have to consume within 5-7 mins as the milk breaks. Rest I find it good but I feel its contains some sugars (not mentioned on the container) as it's so sweet. In my opinion it's better to go with caffe mocca or chocolate if you don't mind the taste but if you want to try something new go for this. Btw it tastes so good with milk and when mixed with water it tastes like diluted copy products of maaza or fruity.",57
5,Biswajoy Ghosh,Best tasting,5.0,22 May 2021,I bought the mango flavoured one. I have tried a number of whey protein supplements and a number of other flavours beside mango by MB itself. This one is by far the most natural tasting protein in my opinion. I mix a scoop with 200ml of chilled water and it tastes exactly like a pulpy mango drink. Will not change this flavour untill I am totally bored.,51

I bought 1kg Mango flavour for the taste but will buy 2kg one next time.Easy to digest.Update 1 : after 5+ scoops this protein feels lighter on stomach as compared with others.Update 2 : I had a diarrhoea after 10+ scoops. Not sure if this bio-enzyme cleans up stomach.Update 3: I'm not sure if this is the right product for me. My stomach gets upset for 1-2 days after having one scoop.Update 4: Everytime I have taken this protein, I had upset stomach or diarrhoea.If you want to empty your bowels then this can be a good laxative.Threw away this after trying several times.",32
9,Prince jain,Know the things,5.0,15 July 2021,I’ve taken hazelnut chocolate flavour so 1st thing for most whey proteins or any bodybuilding supplements are not for all in some body they can give side effects or in some they can give very good effects so stop saying that this protein is right this protein is fake etc things so just take the whey protein don’t complain that the flavour is good flavour is not good etc you need gains your not drinking or taking thing for taste,28

Don’t waste your money,1.0,12 October 2021,"I used Muscletech Nitrotech for a month and I got really good results.Then I came across this product - Musclsblaze Biozyme, and I ordered it because it was on sale. I regret ordering it.I’ve been taking this for almost 15 days now and I’ve not seen any improvement in my physique. I feel like I’m losing my muscles that I had gained in the last 1 month when I was taking Muscletech.I’ve placed a new order for Muscletech and I won’t be taking Muscleblaze anymore.Please don’t waste your money on such low quality products. It won’t benefit you in anyway. Might as well pay a little more and get a good quality supplement.Muscleblaze does really good advertising but their products are terrible.",15

And it turns out it works on me! Look everyone have their body type. With proper workout and diet this whey protein really helped me look lean and muscular. I have finished 1 kg and now ordered 2kg.

Palatability due to taste, unpleasant granular texture even in a solution and poor mixing with water/milk.Pleasantly surprised with this product though, it addresses all three very well.

The company should improve more on the taste for this flavour only.",5
20,AKHIL,Not good as expected,1.0,4 August 2021,"Packing was bad.... the taste of mango flavor is same like a cheap 10rupees softdrink... doesn't feels like a protein shake...even we put 200ml for one scoop feels very lite,  not getting thick taste...I have used MB whey protein before.. by comparing between both its not good....Just okay...not for serious gymholics....",5
21,Pradip,This is good whey,4.0,11 December 2021,I have tried a number of different whey brands in the last 7 years. My go to brand was Nitrotech. This time I decided on Muscleblaze Biozyme since they claimed Labdoor certification. So I bought a 1kg to try. I am quite impressed with the product. The taste is good and over the last month or so I haven’t seen any weight gain though my muscle mass has improved. Of course no one should expect wonders from any whey protein. This is only a supplement. The main thing is exercise and good diet.,2

24,Rudranil G.,One of the best,5.0,18 July 2022,"After using it for 2 months I'm writing this review.It's one of the most recommended pdt in this category. And it shows. 1st the flavor is like chocolate Complan. A tip, if you mix it with more water (>the recommended amount) it tastes better. Also it tastes good with milk. Absorption was good too. I really saw muscle growth, that much I can vouch for. Take it post workout or daily basis for completing your protein needs. Never saw any problem with mixing or with digestion. Price is quite high though. So I'd not recommend this for students, but pros go for it.",2
25,vaiyavi v,Product is not mixing properly and creating lumps.,1.0,2 May 2022,Product smells like a fermented liquid. I added 200ml cold water and one scoop of MB whey as per they instructed. Continuous and vigorous shaking also done. But lumps are formed and flavour also not good. I checked the authenticity of product but its verified one. Still not getting satisfaction from it. I dislike it,3
26,Dinesh Vandra,Mixing,3.0,21 November 2021,"MuscleBlaze surely mixes some cheap quality protein in between or last on the top its the best quality protein💯🔥 but i can feel the taste and after drinking there is some bubbles left in the shaker so its again a sign of mixing a cheap quality protein but those who cannot afford proteins like Optimum Nutrition, dynamite, gnc they can definitely go for it and i suggest you dont go for isolate its waste of money just by reducing 3-4g carbs how it will affect you for a lean gain but it cost 1000 rs more than this whey performance",2
27,Amrit Pal Sandhu,Too much artificial Sugar and Flavour,2.0,23 June 2022,"Used it twice in a day. And I just can't understand why Indian brands use too much of Artificial Sweetner and Flavours....It tastes like you are having 4 tablespoons of Sugar in one drink, which also supress the choclate flavour.Digestion is good.After taste is awful.Packaging is good.Product is genuine no bloating and foul smell noticed.Will update the review after 15 days if use about results on body.Edit 1 (15 days of use)Visible growth in muscle and recovery. Lesser fatigue and higher stamina while exercise.Will not buy a flavored whey 8n future as it limits the options to miz it with juices or shakes. RAW whey gives you more freedom over options to use with other drinks.",One person found this helpful

30,Amazon Customer,One of the worst protein experienced in last 10 years,1.0,27 July 2022,Taste is too much sweet... Too much sugar present it seems and protein percentage very low. As it is raw protein is much better than this which I am using in parallel. I will not recommend it to anyone.,2

34,adhish,Best results and taste,5.0,27 June 2022,"1st of all Magic Mango is literally so good to taste. I'm so critical when it comes to taste so believe me, this tastes like heaven. Results: 3 days of rigorous high intensity resistance training (i ate 100gms of soyachunks split in 2meals and 2 scoops prior and post workout everyday) and there it is. My arms got toned like anything. The clothes fit better now. And it certainly gives you the energy to push you with the exercises and definitely helps in protein synthesis. Best product so far.

39,Amarnath,It's an effective product.,4.0,18 August 2021,MB Biozyme whey performance  is really a good product. It has a faster absorption rate in comparison to its previous products.

Inflation everywhere!______________________________________________Checked my orders. Had ordered ​Whey Energy Choclate for the last 10 times. So thought for a change of flavor and some extra protein.Pros:1.  Mango flavour is not as good as the choclate I was used to but good enough when mixed with milk. May be I need to give it time.2. The biggest pro over whey energy choclate is the absorbency. Mixes so well with chilled milk with same amount of shaking. Didn't find a single lump.3. Extra protein per scoop. I drink half before and half after workout. Good energy during workout and good recovery post workout.4. Unique scoop mechanism.5. No bloating or indigestion of any sort even though some extra protein. I mix 1 scoop with 500ml of chilled milk.Cons :1. Nothing as of now except may be a bit pricey I guess.,
92,Misbah,Best ever protien,5.0,5 August 2021,I have used this protien since 10 days and I can say that it's good protien it's taste is awesome also it digests quickly I have used almost all imported brands but this one is nest level better than asitis better than bigmuscle better than imported brands go for it but price is little bit costly on whey protien and biozyme whey isolate is very costly than imported brands I will recommend U only Biozyme performance whey coz it's in budget range but if u want to buy biozyme whey protien and biozyme whey isolate then please don't buy these two because imported brand price and these two price are almost same go only for biozyme performance whey,
93,Monu Banerjee,The Best Whey For Indian,5.0,21 August 2021,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I tried lots of variety in whey protein,but this protein is a one step upper then all other indian brand.I have been using MB Whey for a long time.And The result is great and if u use this whey or any MB product ,then u feel the rusult in one week.. and the best part of MuscleBlaze all information are clearly mention in product packaging..and one more best thing if you buy in amazon d'not worry about authentication bcoz MuscleBlaze all product are the sell form official MuscleBlaze company...just one suggestion for MuscleBlaze plz sand a gift as a shaker or t-shart...if you search any Indian brands so you go with MuscleBlaze..",
94,Nirav d.,Best flavour i have ever tested & tasted till date,5.0,28 May 2021,I have tried bunch of flavours but ordered this Mango flavour for the first time & believe me this is the best flavour i have ever tasted & just try with milk & you're gonna love it ...Just buy it,
95,Vinuth,Just go for a change,4.0,12 June 2021,"Generally for protein shakes, it's better to go with flavours that go well with milk. You can choose flavours like grape, strawberry and mango just for a change.But the problem is the flavour is too sweet and I felt like mango sugar taste and for slow absorption if you take it with milk then you have to consume within 5-7 mins as the milk breaks. Rest I find it good but I feel its contains some sugars (not mentioned on the container) as it's so sweet. In my opinion it's better to go with caffe mocca or chocolate if you don't mind the taste but if you want to try something new go for this. Btw it tastes so good with milk and when mixed with water it tastes like diluted copy products of maaza or fruity.",
96,Biswajoy Ghosh,Best tasting,5.0,22 May 2021,I bought the mango flavoured one. I have tried a number of whey protein supplements and a number of other flavours beside mango by MB itself. This one is by far the most natural tasting protein in my opinion. I mix a scoop with 200ml of chilled water and it tastes exactly like a pulpy mango drink. Will not change this flavour untill I am totally bored.,
97,Babu lal,Fantastic,5.0,21 April 2021,Fantastic taste and great results. It helps me alot during my competition sessions. I put up almost 6 pound lean muscle mass. Loved it,

I bought 1kg Mango flavour for the taste but will buy 2kg one next time.Easy to digest.Update 1 : after 5+ scoops this protein feels lighter on stomach as compared with others.Update 2 : I had a diarrhoea after 10+ scoops. Not sure if this bio-enzyme cleans up stomach.Update 3: I'm not sure if this is the right product for me. My stomach gets upset for 1-2 days after having one scoop.Update 4: Everytime I have taken this protein, I had upset stomach or diarrhoea.If you want to empty your bowels then this can be a good laxative.Threw away this after trying several times.",
100,Prince jain,Know the things,5.0,15 July 2021,I’ve taken hazelnut chocolate flavour so 1st thing for most whey proteins or any bodybuilding supplements are not for all in some body they can give side effects or in some they can give very good effects so stop saying that this protein is right this protein is fake etc things so just take the whey protein don’t complain that the flavour is good flavour is not good etc you need gains your not drinking or taking thing for taste,
101,AKHIL,Not good as expected,1.0,4 August 2021,"Packing was bad.... the taste of mango flavor is same like a cheap 10rupees softdrink... doesn't feels like a protein shake...even we put 200ml for one scoop feels very lite,  not getting thick taste...I have used MB whey protein before.. by comparing between both its not good....Just okay...not for serious gymholics....",
102,Pradip,This is good whey,4.0,11 December 2021,I have tried a number of different whey brands in the last 7 years. My go to brand was Nitrotech. This time I decided on Muscleblaze Biozyme since they claimed Labdoor certification. So I bought a 1kg to try. I am quite impressed with the product. The taste is good and over the last month or so I haven’t seen any weight gain though my muscle mass has improved. Of course no one should expect wonders from any whey protein. This is only a supplement. The main thing is exercise and good diet.,

And it shows. 1st the flavor is like chocolate Complan. A tip, if you mix it with more water (>the recommended amount) it tastes better. Also it tastes good with milk. Absorption was good too. I really saw muscle growth, that much I can vouch for. Take it post workout or daily basis for completing your protein needs. Never saw any problem with mixing or with digestion. Price is quite high though. So I'd not recommend this for students, but pros go for it.",
106,vaiyavi v,Product is not mixing properly and creating lumps.,1.0,2 May 2022,Product smells like a fermented liquid. I added 200ml cold water and one scoop of MB whey as per they instructed. Continuous and vigorous shaking also done. But lumps are formed and flavour also not good. I checked the authenticity of product but its verified one. Still not getting satisfaction from it. I dislike it,
107,Dinesh Vandra,Mixing,3.0,21 November 2021,"MuscleBlaze surely mixes some cheap quality protein in between or last on the top its the best quality protein💯🔥 but i can feel the taste and after drinking there is some bubbles left in the shaker so its again a sign of mixing a cheap quality protein but those who cannot afford proteins like Optimum Nutrition, dynamite, gnc they can definitely go for it and i suggest you dont go for isolate its waste of money just by reducing 3-4g carbs how it will affect you for a lean gain but it cost 1000 rs more than this whey performance",
108,Amrit Pal Sandhu,Too much artificial Sugar and Flavour,2.0,23 June 2022,"Used it twice in a day. And I just can't understand why Indian brands use too much of Artificial Sweetner and Flavours....It tastes like you are having 4 tablespoons of Sugar in one drink, which also supress the choclate flavour.Digestion is good.After taste is awful.Packaging is good.Product is genuine no bloating and foul smell noticed.Will update the review after 15 days if use about results on body.Edit 1 (15 days of use)Visible growth in muscle and recovery. Lesser fatigue and higher stamina while exercise.Will not buy a flavored whey 8n future as it limits the options to miz it with juices or shakes. RAW whey gives you more freedom over options to use with other drinks.",

396,Adi,genuine product!,5.0,6 October 2021,the item arrived a day late but nevertheless amazon customer service were kind enough to assure me every step of the way that the product will be genuine and I would get it at the earliest. I was worried because there were some reviews about adulteration. Websites like Nutristar do guarantee 100% genuine products but take too long to deliver. Hence I had chosen amazon.Delivery aside the product is really good.1. Excellent taste (chocolate hazelnut flavour)2. Excellent mixability even with milk3. Price on point,

398,Vishwas L.,Good product 100% that set,5.0,27 June 2021,"Generally for protein shakes, it's better to go with flavours that go well with milk. You can choose flavours like grape, strawberry and mango just for a change.But the problem is the flavour is too sweet and I felt like mango sugar taste and for slow absorption if you take it with milk then you have to consume within 5-7 mins as the milk breaks. Rest I find it good but I feel its contains some sugars (not mentioned on the container) as it's so sweet. In my opinion it's better to go with caffe mocca or chocolate if you don't mind the taste but if you want to try something new go for this. Btw it tastes so good with milk and when mixed with water it tastes like diluted copy products of maaza or fruity.",
399,Gaurav Roy,Tastes like a mango drink. Surprisingly good !,5.0,2 October 2021,One of the weirdest protein drink! Surprisingly sweet and snappy like an actual mango drink. Dissolves really well.

Even the quality and grade of container material is damn good.,
400,Sarthak,About the product.,5.0,14 October 2021,"Okay, so this is the first time I started taking whey protein.

The absorbency, Flavor and quality of the whey are pretty good.If you want to lose weight, then I'll recommend you to go with ISOLATE WHEY PROTEIN.Overall, I like the product and will recommend you to go with it.Thanks🤜🤛",
