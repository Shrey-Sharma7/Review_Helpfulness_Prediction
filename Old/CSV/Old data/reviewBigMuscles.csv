Contacted bigmuscles to inquire about the product they didnt even care to divulge information about if it is normal for there product to have these balls because i got it from amazon and not there website .. thankfully amazon accepted the return and i ordered from bigmuscles. Again the same product came with white balls . I inquired again now with bigmuscles they said it is unmixed calcium and it is safe to consume .. this brand has terrible quality control and am returning again  Please stick to muscleblaze instead of this brand . They have better quality control and customer service .",

 1)see in that protein all foam only no protein In that. Last month I used same no small foam also there but now see how much foam is there and it tastes like sugar water. Don't waste money on big muscles. I want my money back2)Red marking ones is my old one. And blue ones is recent one which I recieved yesterday from cloudail. And my old ones I bought from local store. Here see you can see for blue marking ones there is no big muscles logo... But when I scanned they showing authentic. This is new type of scam I think... I immediately mailed to big muscles customer care with all those pictures. Let's see what happens. If it is duplicate I going to book a case against cloudail for sure.",
9,Parshant,False and Fake Product,1,13-Sep-20,I really think that Big Muscle is good company though Ranveer Singh endorsed this brand and  purchased it after seeing it's Protein percentage and BCAA profile on the Ingredients label. I early used Muscleblaze Fuel One Protein it's good in taste and mixiblity good results as well but I'm bored and just ordered this one after i opened the seal i look little clumps in powder and smelling like moisture. Really unhappy with this product don't buy this.,
10,Channabasava R Madari,Read the review before buying.,1,4-Feb-21,"Maybe it has good offer or provides free creatine, but DON'T BUY IT.Packaging and branding over the box is so cheap. The label is rolled over the box like it's done with the hand.It looks nothing like the one in image.That powder inside smells great, tastes great but it's all milk powder enhanced. That protein content is really low.I got this for Rs.1000 with a free creatine. How can anyone produce 1kg of whey protein for just 700.The lab report given by some youtubers such as 20kgdown, Allaboutnutrition found this had only 12g protein scoop i.e., half of what has been claimed. And 18g/scoop in some batches. Many other youtubers found the same but they later removed their video from YouTube when the company paid them to do so.So most of the reviews on youtube are paid by the company.Other options available in same price range such are MB Fuel one or SINEW whey conc. 79I just want other beginners like me to not get cheated and be able to choose the right product for their price. Good luck.",
11,Sahlaik Ahmad,Worst protein.,1,3-Aug-20,"Guys don't buy it! It doesn't tastes good, moreover not even close to expectations! It's way more costly too however it's garbage. You can buy GNC bolt that is much better than this. It's overhyped and it's terrible seriously trust me you will hate it....I want to return and get refund however Amazon says we are sending someone to pickup however no one came so far after 4 attempts. They will ignore your concern and you will end up loosing your money.",
12,abhiman,"Low protein per scoop, but very good VFM",4,7 April 2020,The protein is marketed as isolate but it contains a lot of carbohydrates. Also the mixability is quite bad.I can excuse the mixability because at this price getting a genuine protein is good enough. But the company should not mislead customers by tagging this as an isolate.,

 Unfortunately I’ve been using bigmuscle product since last 2-3 months because I ordered a 2kg and 1kg pack together and it was the biggest mistake of my life. Upon mixing the powder with water it forms a lot of froth and almost 3/4th of the powder turns into the froth and then you have to wait for at least 30 mins for froth to settle down. And I was not getting any visible result using this product so i did some research and found that the labdoor has revoked their certification. So i got curious and saw some videos on YouTube where most of the people did the lab test of the protein and found that this powder only provides 30-40%(10-14g per serving of 35gm) of protein on dry basis whereas it claims almost 71% protein on there label. Maybe this is the reason labdoor has revoked there certification. I hope my review helps you to decide whether to buy this product or not.",

After having this protein , I'm facing issues like bloating and gastricBefore this one i have used Muscle Baze Fuel One , that was also of same price 2299 rs and it was good proteinSo, In my opinion if your budget is tight , then go for muscle blaze or any raw whey protein",

COOKIES AND CREAM was good . ROCKY ROAD & BELGIAN CHOCOLATE  FLAVOURS JUST OK TYPES. HI . I have been using this WHEY PROTEIN since November 2020 . It's a good PRODUCT but  I used cookies and CREAM & Belgian chocolate that seemed good.  But in August 2021 i ordered rocky road flavor.  I swear it's not good & u can feel the muddy crunch while drinking it & that's very irritating.  ABSORBENCY IS OK OK.  BEST FLAVOUR is  COOKIES AND CREAM.  Worst flavour - BELGIAN CHOCOLATE. DANGEROUS FLAVOUR IS  CAFFE LATTE.  Well now about the whey protein  -  It's helping me in getting LEAN MUSCLES.  KUDOS TO MAKE IN INDIA PRODUCT.  JAI HIND  - MOHIT VERMA.

25,Amit Sharma,"Pathetic Taste, fishy product.",1,6-Aug-20,Taste is pathetic to say the least. There are several great options available at this price point. I think Big Muscles should work on their product rather spending money on Bollywood Celebrity endorsements.,

27,Yogesh,This product is a scam,1,4-Jan-22,"I am into serious bodybuilding and only buy certified supplements from offline stores. After a lot of thinking I decided to buy products online especially with the deadly pandemic on the loose. It's easier buying online but what if you don't get genuine products? I saw that this protein was Bestseller and recently certified by Labdoor which is a recognised certification organization. So I bought a 1 kg pack in Belgian chocolate flavor to try out and I’m so disappointed with the product. According to the brand’s claim after a lot of research and reading reviews, the protein they are offering per scoop is not that what is available. This is fake completely. The real protein content is very low than the claim by the brand. It provides only 13 g protein in 35 g serving which is not useful for me at all. How can Labdoor certify such a product? There are much better options in the market than to consume a subpar whey protein. Highly disappointed with the product. Am a bit confused now, is it a fake or a real product?",
28,Ritwik,Bigmuscles cheating people left and right (Only 14gms protein per serving),1,26-Jun-22,"Please avoid at all cost. I made the mistake of going for this because of the product being number one on Amazon and also because the company claimed 25gms of protein per serving. Little did I know that such big companies lie so blatantly with their nutritional facts (and claim FDA approval). Any lab test proof you'd find for this brand would show you how big muscles is cheating customers by providing barely 14gms protein per serving as compared to the claimed 25gms. I switched from muscle blaze fuel one (which gave me great results on just a single serving per day) to bigmuscles and consumed 2 scoops a day for 25 days with a proper training routine and I made so little progress. It hurts me to see how an Indian company with Bollywood figures advertising them, are cheating people. What surprises me is that no action has been taken against these frauds. Amazon needs to act up and provide justice to every customer like me that has been cheated by this company. I would highly recommend to spend a little extra and go for proven brands.",
29,Adi,Not a good choice at all,1,4-Jul-22,Please do some research before buying this product.amount of protien is too less compare to otherbrands.many youtubers have tested it in different labs and uploaded the certificates in google.pls go through it and think twice before buying it.it contains only 35 to 45 gm of protien in 100 gm.they are nicely cheating their customers.intead of doing add with ranveer they could have brought quality to the protien atlest.i am using it since 4 months and am not getting any result when i am comparing with my workouts.then i did more research on this and i found the scam.And one important thing  is that they are simply mentioned that it is labdoor certified.you can directly go to labdoor website and check it.here i am attaching the screenshot,

Company claims 25g protein but lab reports by many youtubers shows 14-15g (you can check youtube).2. I've been using since 5 months. But no results.3. Recent one which I bought had foul smell and bad taste compared to earlier purchase. Even mixability was not good. After consuming I experienced food poisoning. Even my friends experience the same. So I contacted the BigMuscles  through mail for replacement/return. Its been a month and no reply from their side even after 4 mails from me.After that I watched many youtube reviews on this product. Finally realized I'm scammed.If you value your health don't go for this product.,

Mixbility- take out a scoop and put it in the glass and add water and you can see lumps and lumps floating on water. Poor mixbility, have to really shake in the gym shaker too to have consistency.2. Taste - horrible ever tasted whey in my life. Tastes like rotten chocolate milk, with extra sweetness.3. Effectiveness - been using for  few days now, forget about feeling it in the muscles after a long strenuous workout, I doubt it doesn't even give you the required bcaas or other claimed nutrition as on label of this whey.Lets not be fooled by R Singh endorsement and buy this. Its a garbage product. They are high on marketing and zero on product research and development. Big Muscle should consider putting more on product betterment than getting endorsements by A listed stars. At the end its the consumers who need to be happy not your bollywood celebs.",

When I started using it, it was the most adorable whey protein which also tastes good. Considering the results, if it's pure whey, irrespective of brand it will give you the results. It's a myth that results vary from brands to brands. Actually the quality varies from brand to brand which ultimately impacts results. Anyway, talking about this bigmuscle's whey, the advantages are it's affordable, tastes good, it's a blended Protein and most importantly we will rarely encounter fake or duplicate product.

But this one has the best taste of them all. It tastes very natural and doesn't have a medicinal smell.I needed to buy a shaker for Quista as it used to not mix properly, but you can mix this with a spoon as well. It tastes great and no additional sugar required.The fact that it's so cheap and also comes with creatine is unbelievable. Go for it if you find this anywhere below ₹1500.",

Froth is extra ordinary thick and will not settle down, so u don't drink a shake but have to drink the froth.As far as results are concerned I have to update it after some time.",
61,Saurabh,Don't Even Think Of Buying it. Worst Product 😡,1,23-Oct-20,"Damn it's not an authentic protein,big muscle is just fooling the customers with the discount. It smells and tastes so worst! It's flavour doesn't even feel like drinking protein, and I even the the quality of protein is not good. It's like some milk powder mixed with atta. Didn't Expect Such A poor product from well known brands big muscle and Amazon.I want Return For the Product.",
62,Mohammad Zain,What happens when you don't know anything about big muscles,1,28-Jul-22,When I bought this product first time it was quite good and then I thought to buy it again but the second time when I bought this Belgium chocolate flavour I was really upset because the mixbility was not so good and it has small pieces of stones in IT firstly ignore them I thought I am just being to careful but when I use this consequentively regularly the small pieces of stones are coming in every scoop i don't know what the guys are selling but I honestly honestly tell you to not to buy this product and don't get to greedy about the price because they are not selling what you guys are thinking.,
63,MADHURJYA PROTIM BORAH,"Good, Certified and pocket friendly",4,12-Dec-21,"Firstly coming to its taste, I ordered vanilla flavour everthing is fine but I found the sweetness bit more for me. IDK this may be because earlier i used their raw isolate whey. But in my point of the sweetness is more.2. Mixability is good.3. Packaging is good.But yes in the container they have not printed the labdoor stump idk is this because the product i received is from previous batch or its like this only any ways this is not my concern because I have gone through the report in labdoor site.3. Doesn't feel bloated.Its been 2 days after consuming for 1month i will update my review...",
64,Biryani Hut,Inefficient,1,9-Aug-20,"Mixability is not so good  but the major problem is lack of Digizymes.Hence not so easy for beginners or people who will be using whey for first time & may cause bloating.Big Muscle Taste is decent, packaging is good butDigestibility is truly not so efficient compared to other brands.Better go for ""My Fit Fuel Advance 100%""",
65,Samrat,"Disgusting flavour, it has a sickening aftertaste",2,5-Feb-21,"The taste is horrible. It has a sweet milky flavour which will make you feel sick after consuming it. I tried it with water and milk, both options were pathetic. I somehow drink it these days because I don't want my money to go to waste so need to finish it.Whether it helps in gaining muscle weight or not, that I can only tell after a month of consumption. Once my bottle is over, I'm never repurchasing it again. I'd rather go for Endura mass, even though comparatively it has lower protein content, atleast its taste is bearable.",
66,Customer,It doesn't have a normal texture like other proteins.,1,8-Jun-21,"I've tried most of the other proteins like Optimum Nutrition, MuscleBlaze etc. This one doesn't have the regular texture and is different from the ones I ordered. The powder is very free and spills everywhere. Only reason I bought it was because it was on offer. If you find it on offer and are going to buy it because it's cheap, DONT. switch to Scitron Raw, it's really cheap and also has 0 carbs",
67,nikhil,"Cheap quality protein, but OK at this price",1,9-Oct-21,"Don't go with soo much good reviews, it's just an Average protein in taste and effectiveness.The reason behind soo much good reviews is that in each packet,they send in this 100 rs cashback coupon, that you'll get after posting a good review and then sharing the screenshots at the given number.Go for it only if you have limited budget",
68,Ranapar,"Low solubility, My personal recommendation - avoid this whey",1,16 April 2021,"The product is overall nothing too great. Maybe Good for beginners considering competitive price range, however I would not recommend anyone to take this. Muscles will still be tired inspite of drinking this and as far as muscle growth is considered I would rate it at 1 star.....Solubility in water is very poor and it takes time and lots of stirring for the powder to dissolve. Overall summary- avoid this",

My all time favourite is strawberry flavour..salted caramel and Rocky road are also good flavours i gave tried those also...i actually loved salted caramel..,

Best recommended after a workout with water and it helps to grow the muscles and repair them in a faster way , i have tried many other whey proteins in this price range but with my perception big muscles whey protein turns out to be the best in the price segment because of the quality of whey it offers is very good , i would recommend it to everyone , try it once and you would definitely like this product.",

Amazon customer care told me to contact BM directly.",

When I recieved it packaging and everything was great even the smell of the flavour was there, however once you mixed it or use your shaker the consistency of the protein becomes foamy and isn't thick even after using the recommended scoops and water too. I won't be ordering this flavour again unless this problem is resolved because I haven't faced this with other flavours or other brands as well. If you do order consider it an experiment which can result one of two ways.",

80,verified purchaser shruti,pathetic quality,1,19-Aug-21,dont buy unless you want to drink sugar and milk powder. This product has paid reviews only! Worst quality protein. you can actually see dirt in the product . Just because it is little cheap doesn’t mean that it is worth buying. Rather don’t drink protein and take natural food . Again i repeat NOT WORTH IT.,
81,Pooja Srisrimal,Very bad flavor,2,29-Jul-22,"This brand is ver good for their protein powders and flavors. I really like the Belgian chocolate flavor but i decided to try another flavor and chose cookies and cream. The second i tasted it, i knew it was too sweet and didn’t sit right in my stomach. I ended up just chugging it all only to puke it out an hour later. I tried again later in the evening after my workout and the same happened. I drank it just to puke it out. And any other foods i had in the day didn’t upset my stomach like this shake. If you’re looking for a protein powder, this bran is really good but not the cookies and cream flavor",
82,Shivratna ingale,This protein gives only 13 gram protein in one scoop,1,9-Jul-22,This product is fake because i watched so many videos on YouTube about this protein... All YouTuber tested this in lab and their lab test say's very low protein in this product..... I got that answer why this product price is so low..... I will not buy again this protein and this company product.... If you are seeing this message BM then reply why the lab report showing low protein in the product...!!!!!!!!!!!!!,

Telling it has Sugar and Malto Dextrin put in it.....i could not clarity over it..... So a bit confused even after using it....Regarding mixability, It seemed not to cause any problem... Atleast to me..... Depends on whether you put water and then powder or powder and then water... Or water powder and water.... Try whichever combo works",
87,Anu sharma,Not for everyone,2,4-Jun-22,It includes sucralose which is way more sweeter than refined sugar. It is too sweet to have it you don't consume high sugar quantity. It is not suitable for diabetes and people with insulin resistance or pcos. If you don't have any of these issues you can have it for muscle building or to fulfill daily protien need.,
88,Satyam M.,Excellent for Beginners,5,27 April 2022,Taste is excellent.Verified Purchase from BigMuscles Official Website.Also have tested MuscleBlaze product and it was ok ok.So I would recommend this over MB.Great with Milk but it takes a lil time to digest so take cold water instead and it blends easily.I take 1 Cup of Protein Powder1 Cup of Oats2 BananasSome Dry FruitsAnd grind them in mixer grinder with cold water and it tastes excellent.1Kg took me 2 Months to finish daily once after workout.And the result was pretty effective I would say. Just go for it. It won't disappoint. Bought this after a lots of research so I'm pretty happy.,
89,Harun,Tastes disgusting and soapy,2,26-Aug-21,"It does the job, absobancy and results are great, but the taste and texture is absolutely horrible.It tastes soapy and bitter and develops a lot of foam and it also makes whatever you mix with is extremely slimy and coats your throat in a weird way",

91,Viraj Gajare,Really Good Results,4,6-Oct-20,This product offers really good protein content at the price hence great results too.I did not suffer any digestion problems either.Really Value for Money and Great For People who want to meet their goals. The Flavour Can Be Better.,

 Many of the potential benefits are based on single studies and more evidence is required before making definitive judgment.Whey protein is a mixture of beta-lactoglobulin, alpha lactalbumin, bovine serum albumin, and immunoglobins.Possible benefits include weight loss and lowering cholesterol.Possible dangers include nausea and headaches, but at moderate doses, whey protein is not considered dangerous. and for this big muscle give the premium whey gold adorable price and its rich taste make it delightful and it give help you in recovery and in my opinion my dean beginner go for it you can't get such a prefect whey protein in such price 😎✌🏻",
95,sunny12,I seen results in my muscles,5,19-Jul-21,I am doing gym from last 10 years. I am not a professional guy but I know the protein value and it's taste better.From long time I was used other company protein's from the advice of my gym trainer's.But in corona lockdown I planned to do the gym in home with my own dumbles and different protein. Someone my friend recommend this protein and I just buy it.Guys believe me this protein gave me good results as compared to last ten years. I don't know why my muscles are growing exactly Either this is due to this protein or my change of gym in home.But overall I noticed that this protein is good and you can achieve lean muscles without fat but if you do the good exercise only.,
96,Joshi,Excellent Product for all levels of gym goers at an affordable price,4,22-Oct-21,"I'm amazed after using this product because I've used products like ON, Muscle tech and MB but this one is nothing less compared to those brands and not to forget those brands are way too costly, almost double the price. I've chosen this product because of the brand BM nutrition which is highly recognized and Amazon offered it at a very low price. However, all my doubts got cleared after using it. I'm the proof that this product gave me excellent results combined with good workout volume and I could easily maintain my lean mass!Pros:- High brand value- Affordable price compared to other brands- Same results compared to other brands, provided your workout volume is good enough- No side effects- wonderful taste,I've tasted Belgian chocolate and Rocky road, both are superb!- Gives BCAA + Glutamic Acid with Whey protein, most brands have less or no amounts of these, it really helps in muscle recovery and repair- will last 30 days comfortably if taken 1 scoop per day- Absorbency is good, will see results in a week's time, again only with good workout volume and sufficient rest for bodyCons- mixing in a non shaker will take time(3-4 mins) but if you have a protein shaker, it only takes 10-15 secondsI would say, go for it and doesn't matter if you are a beginner or advance level gymmer! It's sure worth more than what we are paying for!",

99,Rishi kapoor,Not satisfied with flavour,3,6-Oct-21,So I have been using big muscles products form a long time and they haven’t disappointed me. But this time I decided to order strawberry milkshake flavour and it was very bad. It doesn’t even close to strawberry flavour. I have used their many products and they are very good. But this strawberry flavour needs very much improvement otherwise the product is very good. You can go for the chocolate flavour but don’t order strawberry milkshake.,
100,Sreehari R.,Extremely disappointed,2,4-Jan-22,"Only good thing about it is that it tastes like a milk shake. Everything else is disappointing.On shaking, it foams up like beer and if you try to scoop it up, powder gets strirred up and gets mixed with air like dust. Easy to make you sneeze.You'd also burp a lot after drinking because of injesting too much froth.Not going to buy again",

It has a hint of medicinal touch to it which makes it very bland.",
104,subhajeet Bhattacharya,good whey protein,5,12-Jan-22,"It's a good whey protein..The taste is amazingIt's authentic and it came with a scratch code with which you can verify the authenticity of this whey protein..However the results depend upon how you train and how much protein intake your body gets per day..I took two scoops per day, one scoop along with breakfast, one scoop after workout and sometimes one scoop at night but it's better you take casein at night because it's a slow digesting protein..You need to take the required amount of protein per day for Muscle Protein Synthesis so that your muscles can grow..So don't expect amazing results by just taking one or two scoops of this whey per day..Your diet must also include whole foods with good protein content along with this supplement..Foods like chicken breast, eggs, broccoli, pulses, cheese, yogurt, soya chunks, fish, nuts, peanut butter etc should also be taken along with this whey protein..If you do everything correctly, you will surely see the results like im seeing 🔥",

112,Goutham,Taste of flavor differs from the one ordered through company website,2,13-Aug-21,Brought this product last week. I have already purchased vanilla flavor from the company’s official website. But this time i brought it from amazon. I can feel the difference in taste. It makes me wonder if the sellers are diluting the vanilla flavour by adding filler substances. I Will never order this again from amazon. Please order directly from bigmuscle nutrition’s official website.,
113,nayim ali khan,DONT BUY!!! VERY BAD PRODUCT,1,22-Jul-21,I have been using protein powder for quite a while now. I have used BigMuscles earlier but now their quality has dropped drastically. The product forms an insane amount of froth which does not go away even after 5 mins of swirling which basically means either the product is spiked or the raw material used was the cheapest available. Please don't go for BigMuscles for now even if you are a regular customer as it's not the same.,
114,Suresh choudhary,Awesome Product taste and Benefits,5,1-Dec-21,"Awesome Product: First time ever i got this Super Protein Box. Too much delicious strawberry Flavor. Great Protein Supplement i ever purchased 😋. I m using it from five days and seeing good results in my body. Too much tasty flavour. You should try it. You will never forget its Taste and Benefits.Whey protein powder usually contains added flavours, as it doesn’t taste very appetizing by itself. If you are considering buying whey protein powder though, make sure that it doesn’t have added sugar.The protein content in it can easily supplement about 25-50 g of your protein intake. It’s an easy way for fitness enthusiasts, weight-loss hopefuls and other people, who lack adequate protein in their diet, to consume it. If you’ve happened to try flavoured whey protein, you wouldn’t want to miss out on this protein source. You can add it to your protein bars and shakes, or have it as a meal replacement.I recommended u to please Use this Product and See it Benefits.",

117,Akshay Kale,Fake protein...go for muscleblaze fuel,1,1-Dec-21,1) From just the texture of the product the regular whey protein user will identify it is fake. Poweder is not at all like a whey.2) Even after drinking this protein you will not recover and will have body pain throughout the day with sleepy head.

124,Amit,Protein content has been spiked with nonesstial amino acid,3,20-Sep-21,Well it's protein content is 25 grm.but actual protein content is 8 to 10 grm per scoop .why I am saying this because when u will take test of these bigmuscles u will get accurate 25 grm of protein.but it's spiked method of mixing non essential amino acid so whenever to take any lab test of big muscles u will get satisfied with 25 grm of protein.but actuallt it's only 8 grm.these company are making fool to beginers.just watch fit muscle Gaurav Taneja has explained so well.  Its better to go with expensive or trusted brands rather than cheap brand.my protein they claim 25grm scoop 20 grm 100%protein .which is justified.and it's expensive.but yes those who can't afford expensive one can go with this.,

These days getting original proteins itself is a challenge. Trustworthy seller I can say.Getting BCAA for free is like cherry on the too. Tried for two days during workout, can feel the difference.Thanks Amazon !",
126,Samay karani,Does it actually have 25gms protein ?,2,23 April 2021,"Maltodextrin is harmful, might increase your sugar level. Flavor is good, other than that the results that I'm getting are not satisfactory. I doubt that there is 25gms of protein in one scoop. Buy at your own risk.",
127,Neha Shukla,Taste wise good!!,3,3-Aug-21,Taste good. Got the genuine protein not duplicate.Too early to say anything I'm using this protein for the first time and today my second.So after consuming it for month I'll comment on that.,
128,Partha Sarathi Chakravarty,Poor quality product maintenance & lack of attention,1,8-Mar-21,This product has been delivered mouldy. No wonder Amazon doesn't pay enough attention to the products stored in their warehouses. This could most definitely cause a potential health hazard.  This is an instance that a big corporation like Amazon couldn't live up to its name.,
129,Prashant Katheriya,Decent product but it's not pure whey isolate,4,29-Jan-22,"Its a decent whey protein concentrate but definitely it's not a proper whey isolate, taste is good, solubility is decent, box as you can see in the pictures is only half full, overall at this price point this is what you get. Will post the results.",
130,Gautam,Good Protein,5,16-Dec-21,"I am using this product from last 3 months and its results are really amazing, Flavor wise little strong but i like belgian chocolate ,easy to digest and no bloating issue. Super fast to dissolve. It is very versatile product as it can be used in many ways. But always prefer to mix in water and though the taste might feel bad first few times but you get used to the milky taste in it after two three days and start liking it. I love to drink it as it is more than any flavoured one. Go for it if you are on a budget and wanna drink good protein or you find it useless to spend on flavours.",
131,saravana k.,Honestly One of the best whey isolate in Market,5,16-Aug-22,"I used to take this at morning post workout,I felt fast Recovery from muscle breakdownVisible muscle pump  (2scoops = 50grams (chicken = 500 gram = 150 grams protein)Easily digestive whey isolate protein powder keep it up Bigmuscle nutrition technical teamNote : please increase Leucine value for more protein synthesis.",

If u are not making money out of ur physique and wants to go for fitness then this protein will do the work. Budget friendly. I have been using it from past 4 months and the results are great with proper diet and exercise.,
136,Satya,Best protein suppliment with gold veriant,5,26-Jul-21,Very good product. Being an athlete I will come to the point where it makes more sense.Pros:1. Decent mixability.2. Cost effective.3. Well packed.4. No added sugarCons:1. Taste can improve.2. The thickness of the shake is missing.,
137,Amarjit Sarma,Good protein,5,26-Aug-21,Got this one in a very cheap price. Using it for 1 month now. And have to say its really good at such a price. I have used 5 brands till now and mostly raw whey concentrate. All are good. The flavor is the bonus here. As well as the price for a gold whey.,

141,dhaval,Go for it!!!,5,10-Dec-21,I bought this product from Amazon and it was delivered within 2 days. It is a genuine product. I also got it authenticated and it says that product is good. I bought chocolate flavour and it mixes well in milk. If you are looking to buy a whey protein go for it. It is useful. 💪👍,
142,Himanshu,No labdor certification tag on the Box,3,11-Dec-21,"No labdor certification on the box. We can say that they are fooling us by the name labdor certification. On Amazon they mentioned labdor certification but when I recive the order, there is no labdor certification on the box. They need to fix this issue . As a consumer I will not recommend this if you are a beginners and student it's totally waste of money as it is not sure you are getting 25g Or 20g.",
143,Karan Singh,Don't buy It,2,28 April 2022,"This product offer 25g protein in 35g scoop (71g protein in 100g) as label.

So, take decision wisely.",
144,Arup,nice but bcaa packet is very bad,4,5-Jun-21,i receive this product in good condition but BCAA packet is damaged and the inside the packet the powder is also damaged. very bad but the whey protein container is good and inside material is also good.,
145,Bhavik,I doubt on product,1,24 April 2022,Before I purchased 1 kg pack i have bought two 500 gm pack(Belgian chocolate) but both have different test. One is chocolate flavoured but another not contain chocolate flavour.After that I have bought 1 kg pack with Belgian chocolate flavour but it is not tested like chocolate even though it tested like without any flavour.This experience make me doubt on the product. Is it trusted? Are they give all nutritions listed on the product? I don't think so.,
146,Updesh Khandelwal,For low budget purposes,3,12 April 2022,It’s not good & bad also..if you dont have enough money to purchase higher end products than you can go for it. I’ve tried this personally i didn’t face any issues regarding health or bloating it mix well with my shaker and easily digest it..but i didn’t see the result on my muscle growth…I’m taking care of my regular and what minimum diet i should take…overall i would suggest if you have low budget and your main goal is to not bulk/gain heavy weight only you want daily protein than you can go for it,

And colour is aslo different. I don't know how the same protein got changed in taste and colour.,
151,Roshan Banik,Satisfied,5,2-Jan-22,Its a good pickup product in this price range for those who do workout and also wants to maintain their daily protein intake. The taste is also good. Though its a budget product so the powder don’t mix immediately unlike the costlier ones. Also a good options of flavours are available which is nice too.,

Next time I ordered cafe latte flavour I don't know what was issue with product lot's and lot's of forth formation more forth formation than detergent powder I used product, that was big mistake I suffered from gastric issues with prolonged 4 months lots of medical expenses. Nausea,, gastric issues, indigestion can't have normal food for months . I can't trust BIGMUSCLE any more.",
1832,Santosh K Rapaka,One of the worst protein powders in the market,1,3-Aug-22,Never buy this protein powder it's one of the worst protein powders available in the market. The company mentioned 24gms protein in scoop but where you get it tested from labs it's will hardly give 15gms protein in one scoop max. It's has digestive issues as well. Doctor choice and Big muscles are same brand under one company. This two companies are fraud don't fall prey to  that youtubers influencers and celebrities promote this brand because they get paid for that. Be careful it might damaged your kidney or liver in long run by using this cheap and low quality protein powders.,
1833,Nitin Sarpal,Useless,5,21-May-22,"It is better to take natural diet rather than taking these protein shakes or supplements especially in INDIA which we don't know what's in there. It is better you eat well, exercise regularly to stay fit. Many of the protein products are abused in our country INDIA. They have written in the product that labdore tested. Labdore testing is not in INDIA. So many of the supplements companies can write anything because they know people wont be able to check the authenticity of the product anyway. Also we wont be able to check the bio availability of the product. Please beware before you buy any supplement in future.",
1834,Mohd Ayyoob,Best flavoured whey protein you can get.,5,11-Jan-22,"I brought it's 2kg pack on 5 dec which costed 2818 i.e 1409 per kg and today is 10th of jan. On 5 dec my weight was 74.90 and on 10th jan my weight is 76.20. So yes it has definitely helped me gain muscles, considering i train every muscle twice a week. Since it is labdoor certified I had no trust issues buying this product.The flavour Belgian chocolate tastes good and is easily absorbed after 30 mins with no indigestion problems. I also used muscle blaze whey and I can say it tastes better than that. Though the muscle blaze whey gave better results than this. Anyways it was costly also at 1800 rs/kg.Therefore, i highly recommend this to anyone out there thinking of buying protein supplement. Today's it is priced at 1550 rs approx, still cheaper than competitions which are unflavoured in this range.",
1835,Akash Singh,"Not worth it, protien content is much lower than what it's being clained",2,15-Sep-21,It very dissapointing... I have tested this protien in lab... and its only 47gm present in 100gm but the brand is claiming as 75gm per 100gm.I was using this since 2019..Please dont fall for lower price.,
1836,aniket singh,Worst protein ever,1,25-Feb-22,Worst protein ever in my life ..protein percentange is 44% per 100gm 💔As well as mixablity is very poor and the protein content is very very low . So i request Bigmuscle to stop making people fool 🙏 plz stoped it ASAP,
1837,shwetank,BEWARE. DO NOT BUY,1,25-Aug-20,BEWAREDO NOT BUT THIS CHEAP PROTEINEVERY BATCH HAS DIFFERENT TASTE AND TEXTUREI ORDERED(BELGIAN CHOCOLATE-3RD TIME) FROM OFFICIAL WEBSITE AND RECEIVED AWFUL SMELLING SAND THIS TIME.I CHECKED ITS ORIGINAL BUT REALITY IS DIFFERENT.GO FOR ANY OTHER BRANDYOU CAN'T EVEN TASTE IT.CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS USELESS AND RUDE.CHEAP BRAND.Packaging is changed every month.This time no branding no sticker on the cap of jar.The vanilla flavour is so weird and synthetic.Also the texture is a little cakey or something wetty.you all are advised to avoid buying this flavour also.,
1838,Nirav,Value for Money,4,18-Nov-21,I have been a regular ON user. but wanted to big muscles whey. I tried cookies and cream.1. 100% value for money .. 30% to 40 % cheaper then ON2. Cookies and cream taste was good. I am ok with sweet tastes. I liked it. Ordered same again3. absorbs well.. not the greatest. But works. Definitely it's thicker powder4. With milk can be tried.. texture is best then5. Functionally changing to big muscles did not result in any decline of energy or recovery. So I feel its on par with ON whey in terms of effectiveness.6. Packaging is premium.. with offers.. it becomes a sweet dealAll in all good value for money product,
1839,MskTechCorp,Cheap Quality Product with Digestion issues,1,23-Sep-20,"I ordered it from their website only, I ordered Vanilla Creme Flavour But I got Delivered with Caffe Latte ( worst Flavour ) Worst Staff and services. Coming to Product review the Protein is Cheap Quality product and smells odd and bad when opened. After consuming 1st scoop I got Health issues like Vomiting, Diahrea, Disgestion problems. I stopped consuming with one scoop Only.As the price low as the Product Quality was low.And also Irregular heart beats with High blood pressure noticed after consuming this.Previously I had consumed many other brands but this one is worst Quality with occuring new health issues for a Healthy Person.See this Whey Protein Powder I ordered vannila Again, it's taste is like coffee, the Vanilla flavour also contains coffee, and sugar added, it's sweet too. Very cheap tricks made by company, Note :- Beware ...! not a good one for Health.",

1845,Akshat,You have to try it if you are a beginner.,5,9-Nov-21,"Good absorbance and great taste. However, the Caffe Latte flavour is a bit better but this isn't bad either. Anyways, taste doesn't really matter if it can do what it is supposed to. Gives you a great pump, muscle recovery is amazing, and also helps in muscle soreness as well. All in all, a balanced combination of all the amino acids, whey and cals is great, and it gives you a good result in the end. Worth it!",

1929,Mohit,Best protein,5,6-Oct-20,Best protein ever big muscles nutrition is the best indian brand company.I have such best results with this protein.,
1930,Akshay desai ad,Best whey protein which comes in Belgian chocolate flavour,5,1-Nov-21,Tried it for over a week now .best chocolate flavour whey protein I have come across as I have tried few others as well.. so starting with packaging the packaging is superb and has a barcode to check the original product as there are very fake sellers out in the market..It each scoop has 25 grm protien per serving 5.5 grams bcaas . 4 grams glutamic and most important 0 grams sugar which makes it the perfect whey in it segment.. do give it a try,
1931,Prakhar Verma,"Pick this one, best for the price.",5,20-Oct-21,After scouring the internet this product is the best I've found in the price range. The taste if really good and has good mixability as well. Whey is a natural form of protein so don't worry about safety as this is absolutely safe to consume. You definitely need a good workout before consuming this.I use water to make my protein shake but milk is fine too.Pro tip: Use a heaving teaspoon of coffee to add a nice nuance to the flavor.,
1932,Ayush Nigam,Good Porduct but taste could be better,5,29-Oct-21,"Have been using for a month...ordered 500gm Belgian chocolate to try first..Wish cafe latte or vanilla flavour would available for 500gm. About flavour, it's okish could be better but who cares about taste when you look at product offerings with 0 sugar and 25g of protein for 35g of serving size..thats most important factor. Other brands don't provide that high protein contant per serving size..plus this product gives detailed amino acids content which is very good (which means this brand is not shy providing amino acids profile). Powder is dissolvable with little shake, no glums noticed which is good point. Plus no after affects like digestion problem faced which means quality product. Also manufacture date received was May 21. Overall satisfied with product but taste could be better. Its not aweful but not delicious",
1933,Shanmugam,Great Taste and Convenient Packaging - Good for beginners,5,12-Oct-21,"I got this yesterday. It tastes good and very convenient to use as a post work out protein source. I received a 'small token of love' with the purchase and I really liked that idea; you give us a chance to connect back with you in a positive way and also get your product reviewed - a win win situation. That is actually an aspect of the purchase that I liked.1) The container is huge. You don't have to arrange a bottle or container to fill it; it is already filled in a spacious container. You certainly need more 'shelf space' to hold it. It has a label with complete details of all the amino-acids (protein components) present, with their quantity.2) The scoop is usually buried inside, which automatically happens because of the transport. I suggest the manufacturer to keep the scoop separate and easy enough to find; the little guy was playing hide and seek with me and gave me some trouble.3) The recommended usage is to use 180 ml water with one scoop of powder. But a lot of it sticks to the bottom and doesn't dissolve easily. This is probably the case with whey protein in general. But some tips to make it more homogenous drink is appreciated.To manufacturers: Consider including a small usage guide with the product. It may be a novel idea. Not everyone may be interested in consuming 25 grams of protein supplement in a single serving. A protein isolate is a life-saver. But general population lack the knowledge about the importance of protein for various health goals and the ease of supplementing it with a product like this.",
1934,Yash,Good one @ great price,4,25-Oct-21,"Ordered first on great indian festival sale to check quality at low price and liked the product. Ordered second one after a week (got a review card through what i can get 100 cash back too. this is going to be the genuine review but just I wanted to Tu so you people that even you can get hundred rupees cashback on this cheapest product)Taste is good but I was worried about the extra sweet test that was shown in every review. on the contrary, I found it a little less sweeter than I used other expensive supplements like ISO sensation 93. mixability is good, taste is also somewhat good and you get this at very cheap price. I also saw some reviews in which they showed white dot kind of substance in powder. fortunately, I couldn't find it in any of my  jar. all over loved the product and should definitely given a try.",
1935,Prashant,Does what it says,4,3-Nov-21,First of all its a good protein conc. and isolate in this price range. Not sure about the results yet but so far absorbency seems pretty good. Flavour's a okay too. Combined with a proper workout and diet it should just get the job done.,
1936,Harpreeth,It’s very good and wonderful all the way,5,3-Nov-21,"It’s a great product for the start of the workout freaks , THERE I AM 6.6""HEIGHT ANDI AM USING IT'S ONE SCOOP IN POST WORKOUT AND ANOTHER IN EVENING CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH MY GAINING PERIOD,I AM GETTING BETTER RESULTS THEN I EXPECTED.

1937,Andy Rox,Value for money Product,5,14-Oct-21,"They said under the cap that if we write a review on Amazon we get Cashback. But no cashback is received. This is all marketing strategy to increase Rating of the product.Talking about the Product now, it's just ok, I think this is a value for money product as It is quiet cheap so we can't expect expensive quality anyway.",
1938,ROBERT M KUNJU,Best Ever considering the Price.,5,23-Oct-21,"First of all, I noticed the canister was almost full to the top with product. You cant even get a bag of chips that full anymore. The canister is also huge. Much bigger than my more expensive protien that only came half full. So right off I was impressed. I got the Chocolate and it smelled heavenly. I wasn't sure how good it would taste, but upon mixing it with unsweetened Almond Milk was pleasantly surprised. I had no issues with it mixing. I really bought this to bake with and also have been happy with those results and really liked it as well. I highly recommend this product.",
1939,mrunalini,"Definite results, no bloating, easy to digest.",5,10-Oct-21,"It is 100% worth the money. This wehy protein is easy to digest, doesn't cause any bloating issue. Taste good and creamy. It has good amount of protein content. Taste is enhanced when taken in cold water and i prefer it. I have been using it for many months now and I'm getting good results. It comes with bar code that you can scan and check authenticity. In the end; it is a great product.",
1940,Jitender gautam,Good product to begin with,5,9-Nov-21,"5 star ratings are absolutely justifying for this product. I have been using bigmuscles whey protein for last 2 months, and this was my first time i used any protein supplement. I gained 7+ kgs in two months, ofcourse you will have to do excercise for atleast 1 hr and have to take a healthy diet with this. I was taking 4 bananas, 4 eggs and two times protein shake in a day. But results are absolutely visible. If you are beginner then you must chose this protein because you are gonna digest it very easily, and results are absolutely visible.",
1941,Tushar Mane,Very good product,5,31-Oct-21,I have been using expensive whey proteins. One friend suggested Big Muscle proteins. I was skeptical about this initially.. but when I ordered this product.. I got the product in perfect condition. When I started using this product.. I found that this product matches the expensive and imported protein powders. I purchased Strawberry flavor. I found this has great taste. It dissolved very easily in milk. It gives good results.Thanks to Big Muscle team for producing this excellent in much lesser price.,
1942,Mohammed Muzaffar Hussain,Personal Experience using the product.,5,15-Nov-21,"It's been 6 months using this brand product.Gained muscle mass/weight somewhat around 2kg - 3kg and for lean bulking a healthy diet and enough protein is necessary.For my protein intake i use chicken, veggies and protein supplements ( Isolate, blend and concentrate ( off days ) ) Basically i usually consume unflavored raw isolate protein but tried using the new flavors of Big-Muscles Nutrition Protein. I personally suggest if you are a beginner start using with flavors and make an hand on protein supplements later you can explore more things.In conclusion, I can say, best supplement in good friend of budget.",
1943,SOVARAN SINGH,Nice product,5,22-Oct-21,"Purchased this product recently and The product is really amazing i just wanted a protein powder which tastes good and not like soil ( earlier i had) so the taste is chocolaty and since sugar is added, I don't need to add it manually so it's just ready to drink Powder.This product has some Essential Amino Acids which are rarely available in our diet . So i would recommend this to every gym lover and body enthusiastic peoples. Some people found that sugar content is high but it's not it is just for balancing sugar between powder. Overall good combo. Thanks.",

 The protein is marketed as isolate but it contains a lot of carbohydrates. Also the mixability is quite bad.I can excuse the mixability because at this price getting a genuine protein is good enough. But the company should not mislead customers by tagging this as an isolate.",

Thinking to switch to his brand only as it is cheaper too!",
2824,SAHIL SETHI,Loved the flavor,5,14-Oct-21,I have been using big muscles products since 2 years. I am using this protein for the second time. Protein is good around 33 gms of scoop will give you 25 gms of protein. I loved the cafe latte flavor and i have also bought strawberry flavor.,
2825,Channabasava R Madari,Read the review before buying.,1,4-Feb-21,"Maybe it has good offer or provides free creatine, but DON'T BUY IT.Packaging and branding over the box is so cheap. The label is rolled over the box like it's done with the hand.It looks nothing like the one in image.That powder inside smells great, tastes great but it's all milk powder enhanced. That protein content is really low.I got this for Rs.1000 with a free creatine. How can anyone produce 1kg of whey protein for just 700.The lab report given by some youtubers such as 20kgdown, Allaboutnutrition found this had only 12g protein scoop i.e., half of what has been claimed. And 18g/scoop in some batches. Many other youtubers found the same but they later removed their video from YouTube when the company paid them to do so.So most of the reviews on youtube are paid by the company.Other options available in same price range such are MB Fuel one or SINEW whey conc. 79I just want other beginners like me to not get cheated and be able to choose the right product for their price. Good luck.",64
2826,Sahlaik Ahmad,Worst protein.,1,3-Aug-20,"Guys don't buy it! It doesn't tastes good, moreover not even close to expectations! It's way more costly too however it's garbage. You can buy GNC bolt that is much better than this. It's overhyped and it's terrible seriously trust me you will hate it....I want to return and get refund however Amazon says we are sending someone to pickup however no one came so far after 4 attempts. They will ignore your concern and you will end up loosing your money.",63
2827,abhiman,"Low protein per scoop, but very good VFM",4,7 April 2020,The protein is marketed as isolate but it contains a lot of carbohydrates. Also the mixability is quite bad.I can excuse the mixability because at this price getting a genuine protein is good enough. But the company should not mislead customers by tagging this as an isolate.,113

 Unfortunately I’ve been using bigmuscle product since last 2-3 months because I ordered a 2kg and 1kg pack together and it was the biggest mistake of my life. Upon mixing the powder with water it forms a lot of froth and almost 3/4th of the powder turns into the froth and then you have to wait for at least 30 mins for froth to settle down. And I was not getting any visible result using this product so i did some research and found that the labdoor has revoked their certification. So i got curious and saw some videos on YouTube where most of the people did the lab test of the protein and found that this powder only provides 30-40%(10-14g per serving of 35gm) of protein on dry basis whereas it claims almost 71% protein on there label. Maybe this is the reason labdoor has revoked there certification. I hope my review helps you to decide whether to buy this product or not.",23

It is nothing like my old original BM protine.Amazon is not helpling me.Please return this.Update: Still no help from Amazon & from seller or manufacturer too.Total waste of money. Really unhappy with amazon.,1
2837,Shubham,Overall It's Value For Money,4,5-Oct-20,I've been using the product for few months now i haven't seen any significant difference on my muscle size but it definitely gives me more energy when I workout the flavour is average and overall is value for money i know my muscle wouldn't grow miraculously let's hope to get best results after consistent use.,6
2838,Krishnov chakravorty,Product review!,5,18-May-22,"First of all the taste of the protein!So I bought Belgian chocolate flavor 2kgs ,First of all I opened my LetsVeriFy app and was kinda skeptical from the packaging of the product but when I scanned the Barcode and wrote the 5 number pin on the lid it was valid and 100% real ,Then the taste I’ll give it a 7.5 out of 10 it was good there were so lumps in my protein so that was good ,no side effects or indications of diarrhea!But if you are lactose intolerant then I’d prefer u guys to have the protien with water instead of milk !So overall I’ll give the protein 9/10..Should You buy it?Hell yes!Worth every penny!..Is the product real?Most of them are real but if you are skeptical just scan before u open the product if it’s not return it!but it always comes real tbh!..Any side effects?Nah..Ignore all the negative reviews all the negative reviews are from ppl who just started bodybuilding and expect quick growth!Been doing bodybuilding from the past 7 years so trust me this protein is worth it!",1
2839,Suryapratap,One of the best for intermediates,3,3-Nov-21,"I'm using this product for about 1 year or more. I can say that this brand is working hard to improve there products. When I started using it, it was the most adorable whey protein which also tastes good. Considering the results, if it's pure whey, irrespective of brand it will give you the results. It's a myth that results vary from brands to brands. Actually the quality varies from brand to brand which ultimately impacts results. Anyway, talking about this bigmuscle's whey, the advantages are it's affordable, tastes good, it's a blended Protein and most importantly we will rarely encounter fake or duplicate product. In some case I found the product suspicious, but no worries. I just replaced it easily.For beginners and intermediates, this is the perfect one I can recommend.",1
2840,Shushrut,BUY! BUY NOW!! KEEP BUYING THIS!!!,5,6-Mar-21,"By far the best protein drink I've had. It has the perfect flavour, perfect mixability and the perfect combo (since it comes with creatine).I've tried MB, Quista and Sinew, they all have an artificial taste for the chocolate flavour. But this one has the best taste of them all. It tastes very natural and doesn't have a medicinal smell.I needed to buy a shaker for Quista as it used to not mix properly, but you can mix this with a spoon as well. It tastes great and no additional sugar required.The fact that it's so cheap and also comes with creatine is unbelievable. Go for it if you find this anywhere below ₹1500.",1

There is this pungent chemical smell whenever you open lid of the box. Couple of times i used it and you may call it mere coincidence but stomach some what revolted.  I would stick to reputable brands only going forward.  Not using it anymore.",2

Also it has blend of Whey Protein Concentrate & Whey Protein Isolate unlike low priced protein which only have Whey concentrate. This is a high quality protein and also have a good price point. Also Rocky Road flavour is awesome.,1

2875,Khushboo Rani,Foamy like soap,1,19-Oct-21,"I bought it second time but got disappointed. First time, the product didn't make any foam at all. Now, for my second purchase for the same product, a large amount of foam is generating. I have attached images. The foam is also not getting away. This is not genuine protein powder. Amazon customer care told me to contact BM directly.",1
2876,Brandon,Good price but quality isn't upto the mark.,3,30-Aug-21,"I was excited to receive this package because this was the 1st time I was trying a flavour other than chocolate whey. When I recieved it packaging and everything was great even the smell of the flavour was there, however once you mixed it or use your shaker the consistency of the protein becomes foamy and isn't thick even after using the recommended scoops and water too. I won't be ordering this flavour again unless this problem is resolved because I haven't faced this with other flavours or other brands as well. If you do order consider it an experiment which can result one of two ways.",1
2877,Amazon Customer,FAKE AND POTENTIALLY HARMFUL SUBSTANCE !!!,1,27 April 2021,"Fake product, had serious side effects just with 1 sip of this thing, it's definitely not whey protein.

Buy BM when with transparent box only.",4
2879,verified purchaser shruti,pathetic quality,1,19-Aug-21,dont buy unless you want to drink sugar and milk powder. This product has paid reviews only! Worst quality protein. you can actually see dirt in the product . Just because it is little cheap doesn’t mean that it is worth buying. Rather don’t drink protein and take natural food . Again i repeat NOT WORTH IT.,1
2880,Shivratna ingale,This protein gives only 13 gram protein in one scoop,1,9-Jul-22,This product is fake because i watched so many videos on YouTube about this protein... All YouTuber tested this in lab and their lab test say's very low protein in this product..... I got that answer why this product price is so low..... I will not buy again this protein and this company product.... If you are seeing this message BM then reply why the lab report showing low protein in the product...!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1

2882,Ravi B.,Think before and take ur decision single dought in mind felt regret for month,1,11-Jun-21,"Sticker on packing, it's being doutfull to ur mind, are u consuming OG product?,Insted of going through dought in mind go through other product, I get strawberry falver inside, test is not actually better, it's feel u r taking something artificial thing, before buying I also read above + ve review, will not recommend to buy,Consuming from last 2 weeks not observing myself closely not so effective.",2
2883,Umam KHAN,Good protein,5,17-Jun-21,"Product comes with great amount of protein in it. The flavor delivers by big muscle nutrition is out standing.  All the protein management is done very accurately from its protein content to its absorbency,  its flavor,  its mixibility,  its  bioavailability; all are perfectly organised.  Highly suitable for beginners.",2
2884,Anu sharma,Not for everyone,2,4-Jun-22,It includes sucralose which is way more sweeter than refined sugar. It is too sweet to have it you don't consume high sugar quantity. It is not suitable for diabetes and people with insulin resistance or pcos. If you don't have any of these issues you can have it for muscle building or to fulfill daily protien need.,1
2885,Harun,Tastes disgusting and soapy,2,26-Aug-21,"It does the job, absobancy and results are great, but the taste and texture is absolutely horrible.It tastes soapy and bitter and develops a lot of foam and it also makes whatever you mix with is extremely slimy and coats your throat in a weird way",2
2886,Karan C.,Very weak flavour.,2,25-Jan-22,"The flavour is terribly weak and almost non existent, thats not a good thing. The protein is sticky (shows poor quality) and seems loaded a bit heavily with silica. I will not buy again.",1
2887,Goutham,Taste of flavor differs from the one ordered through company website,2,13-Aug-21,Brought this product last week. I have already purchased vanilla flavor from the company’s official website. But this time i brought it from amazon. I can feel the difference in taste. It makes me wonder if the sellers are diluting the vanilla flavour by adding filler substances. I Will never order this again from amazon. Please order directly from bigmuscle nutrition’s official website.,1
2888,nayim ali khan,DONT BUY!!! VERY BAD PRODUCT,1,22-Jul-21,I have been using protein powder for quite a while now. I have used BigMuscles earlier but now their quality has dropped drastically. The product forms an insane amount of froth which does not go away even after 5 mins of swirling which basically means either the product is spiked or the raw material used was the cheapest available. Please don't go for BigMuscles for now even if you are a regular customer as it's not the same.,1
2889,sid,Talcum powder,2,25-Sep-21,Previously I ordered Belgium chocolate flavour.i tried this one and don't want to try any other flavours after this.the texture is just lik talc powder in this where as texture in Belgium chocolate was absolutely fine.,1
2890,siva Dorai,"Sugar is mentioned as zero, but it’s sweet - careful",2,31-Mar-22,"I have been taking this for a while now , despite it’s mentioned as no sugar, when I mix this with hot water itself it has mild sweet. Obviously what the pack says is false, wonder if I was sold fake product!",1
2891,Akshay Kale,Fake protein...go for muscleblaze fuel,1,1-Dec-21,1) From just the texture of the product the regular whey protein user will identify it is fake. Poweder is not at all like a whey.2) Even after drinking this protein you will not recover and will have body pain throughout the day with sleepy head. When I use Muscleblaze fuel I never get body pain post workout because protein content helps to recover the broken muscles. This thing has very low or near to zero protein content.,1
2892,Big b,Fake#fake#fake,1,5-Dec-20,"Fake fake fake fake ......... please don't buy this. I am begging you. Please don't buy this product. This product is totally fake.

2893,rajiv b.,Might not be original,2,28-May-22,"Bought it second time but this time the taste and packaging seemed off, also there were lump left when mixed with normal waterThe sealed on the top was also loosely packedI can’t say that this time the product was original",1
2894,Aman Turup,Absolutely worth the price,5,4 April 2021,I ordered this for my brother since he is into working out and being healthy in general.. didn’t know much about protein powders but saw the reviews of this product and decided to order... the product works really well for my brother when consumed right after workout..he told me to add in the review that the taste of the powder is very rich when added to milk.. it’s totally a steal for the price especially for the quality of it..I would definitely recommend,1
2895,Asim Ali,Messed up my gut,2,7-Sep-21,Mixability is fine. Doesn’t taste that good and above all it has messed up my gut and feeling really bad about it. I’m still left with a lot of this whey and I don’t know what to do. Please think wisely before the purchase.,3
2896,Samay karani,Does it actually have 25gms protein ?,2,23 April 2021,"Maltodextrin is harmful, might increase your sugar level. Flavor is good, other than that the results that I'm getting are not satisfactory. I doubt that there is 25gms of protein in one scoop. Buy at your own risk.",2
2897,Neha Shukla,Taste wise good!!,3,3-Aug-21,Taste good. Got the genuine protein not duplicate.Too early to say anything I'm using this protein for the first time and today my second.So after consuming it for month I'll comment on that.,1
2898,Partha Sarathi Chakravarty,Poor quality product maintenance & lack of attention,1,8-Mar-21,This product has been delivered mouldy. No wonder Amazon doesn't pay enough attention to the products stored in their warehouses. This could most definitely cause a potential health hazard.  This is an instance that a big corporation like Amazon couldn't live up to its name.,2
