Mithun Kartha,Horrible sweet taste!,1,6-Mar-20,Would advise anyone serious about protein powders to avoid it completely. It has artificial sweeteners and also a milk powder derivative. I won't order from this brand again.,
Prasham Dave,Very poor quality control,1,10-Jul-20,"Bought this product first from Amazon , had white balls as in the pictures . Contacted bigmuscles to inquire about the product they didnt even care to divulge information about if it is normal for there product to have these balls because i got it from amazon and not there website .. thankfully amazon accepted the return and i ordered from bigmuscles. Again the same product came with white balls . I inquired again now with bigmuscles they said it is unmixed calcium and it is safe to consume .. this brand has terrible quality control and am returning again  Please stick to muscleblaze instead of this brand . They have better quality control and customer service .",

¬†1)see in that protein all foam only no protein In that. Last month I used same no small foam also there but now see how much foam is there and it tastes like sugar water. Don't waste money on big muscles. I want my money back2)Red marking ones is my old one. And blue ones is recent one which I recieved yesterday from cloudail. And my old ones I bought from local store. Here see you can see for blue marking ones there is no big muscles logo... But when I scanned they showing authentic. This is new type of scam I think... I immediately mailed to big muscles customer care with all those pictures. Let's see what happens. If it is duplicate I going to book a case against cloudail for sure.",
Parshant,False and Fake Product,1,13-Sep-20,I really think that Big Muscle is good company though Ranveer Singh endorsed this brand and  purchased it after seeing it's Protein percentage and BCAA profile on the Ingredients label. I early used Muscleblaze Fuel One Protein it's good in taste and mixiblity good results as well but I'm bored and just ordered this one after i opened the seal i look little clumps in powder and smelling like moisture. Really unhappy with this product don't buy this.,
Channabasava R Madari,Read the review before buying.,1,4-Feb-21,"Maybe it has good offer or provides free creatine, but DON'T BUY IT.Packaging and branding over the box is so cheap. The label is rolled over the box like it's done with the hand.It looks nothing like the one in image.That powder inside smells great, tastes great but it's all milk powder enhanced. That protein content is really low.I got this for Rs.1000 with a free creatine. How can anyone produce 1kg of whey protein for just 700.The lab report given by some youtubers such as 20kgdown, Allaboutnutrition found this had only 12g protein scoop i.e., half of what has been claimed. And 18g/scoop in some batches. Many other youtubers found the same but they later removed their video from YouTube when the company paid them to do so.So most of the reviews on youtube are paid by the company.Other options available in same price range such are MB Fuel one or SINEW whey conc. 79I just want other beginners like me to not get cheated and be able to choose the right product for their price. Good luck.",
Sahlaik Ahmad,Worst protein.,1,3-Aug-20,"Guys don't buy it! It doesn't tastes good, moreover not even close to expectations! It's way more costly too however it's garbage. You can buy GNC bolt that is much better than this. It's overhyped and it's terrible seriously trust me you will hate it....I want to return and get refund however Amazon says we are sending someone to pickup however no one came so far after 4 attempts. They will ignore your concern and you will end up loosing your money.",
abhiman,"Low protein per scoop, but very good VFM",4,7 April 2020,The protein is marketed as isolate but it contains a lot of carbohydrates. Also the mixability is quite bad.I can excuse the mixability because at this price getting a genuine protein is good enough. But the company should not mislead customers by tagging this as an isolate.,
Nayan Ranjan,Not worth,3,3-Mar-20,I don't think it has 25 gm protein per serving also its scoop size is of 35 gm its not pure it has milk powder added,

¬†Unfortunately I‚Äôve been using bigmuscle product since last 2-3 months because I ordered a 2kg and 1kg pack together and it was the biggest mistake of my life. Upon mixing the powder with water it forms a lot of froth and almost 3/4th of the powder turns into the froth and then you have to wait for at least 30 mins for froth to settle down. And I was not getting any visible result using this product so i did some research and found that the labdoor has revoked their certification. So i got curious and saw some videos on YouTube where most of the people did the lab test of the protein and found that this powder only provides 30-40%(10-14g per serving of 35gm) of protein on dry basis whereas it claims almost 71% protein on there label. Maybe this is the reason labdoor has revoked there certification. I hope my review helps you to decide whether to buy this product or not.",

Syed Shahbaz ali,Worst Protein I have ever Used,1,12-Feb-21,"This is worst protein I've ever used.

After having this protein , I'm facing issues like bloating and gastricBefore this one i have used Muscle Baze Fuel One , that was also of same price 2299 rs and it was good proteinSo, In my opinion if your budget is tight , then go for muscle blaze or any raw whey protein",
n,taste might take while to get used to,5,17-Aug-20,"i did notice the taste of this powder is a bit different than other powders(not in a good way), but i use this only to make protein cakes and not as a post workout shake, and that this powder does better than muscleblaze, so i will buy this again, but will not recommend as a primary protein shake to anyone",

COOKIES AND CREAM was good . ROCKY ROAD & BELGIAN CHOCOLATE  FLAVOURS JUST OK TYPES. HI . I have been using this WHEY PROTEIN since November 2020 . It's a good PRODUCT but  I used cookies and CREAM & Belgian chocolate that seemed good.  But in August 2021 i ordered rocky road flavor.  I swear it's not good & u can feel the muddy crunch while drinking it & that's very irritating.  ABSORBENCY IS OK OK.  BEST FLAVOUR is  COOKIES AND CREAM.  Worst flavour - BELGIAN CHOCOLATE. DANGEROUS FLAVOUR IS  CAFFE LATTE.  Well now about the whey protein  -  It's helping me in getting LEAN MUSCLES.  KUDOS TO MAKE IN INDIA PRODUCT.  JAI HIND  - MOHIT VERMA.

Amit Sharma,"Pathetic Taste, fishy product.",1,6-Aug-20,Taste is pathetic to say the least. There are several great options available at this price point. I think Big Muscles should work on their product rather spending money on Bollywood Celebrity endorsements.,

Yogesh,This product is a scam,1,4-Jan-22,"I am into serious bodybuilding and only buy certified supplements from offline stores. After a lot of thinking I decided to buy products online especially with the deadly pandemic on the loose. It's easier buying online but what if you don't get genuine products? I saw that this protein was Bestseller and recently certified by Labdoor which is a recognised certification organization. So I bought a 1 kg pack in Belgian chocolate flavor to try out and I‚Äôm so disappointed with the product. According to the brand‚Äôs claim after a lot of research and reading reviews, the protein they are offering per scoop is not that what is available. This is fake completely. The real protein content is very low than the claim by the brand. It provides only 13 g protein in 35 g serving which is not useful for me at all. How can Labdoor certify such a product? There are much better options in the market than to consume a subpar whey protein. Highly disappointed with the product. Am a bit confused now, is it a fake or a real product?",
Ritwik,Bigmuscles cheating people left and right (Only 14gms protein per serving),1,26-Jun-22,"Please avoid at all cost. I made the mistake of going for this because of the product being number one on Amazon and also because the company claimed 25gms of protein per serving. Little did I know that such big companies lie so blatantly with their nutritional facts (and claim FDA approval). Any lab test proof you'd find for this brand would show you how big muscles is cheating customers by providing barely 14gms protein per serving as compared to the claimed 25gms. I switched from muscle blaze fuel one (which gave me great results on just a single serving per day) to bigmuscles and consumed 2 scoops a day for 25 days with a proper training routine and I made so little progress. It hurts me to see how an Indian company with Bollywood figures advertising them, are cheating people. What surprises me is that no action has been taken against these frauds. Amazon needs to act up and provide justice to every customer like me that has been cheated by this company. I would highly recommend to spend a little extra and go for proven brands.",
Adi,Not a good choice at all,1,4-Jul-22,Please do some research before buying this product.amount of protien is too less compare to otherbrands.many youtubers have tested it in different labs and uploaded the certificates in google.pls go through it and think twice before buying it.it contains only 35 to 45 gm of protien in 100 gm.they are nicely cheating their customers.intead of doing add with ranveer they could have brought quality to the protien atlest.i am using it since 4 months and am not getting any result when i am comparing with my workouts.then i did more research on this and i found the scam.And one important thing  is that they are simply mentioned that it is labdoor certified.you can directly go to labdoor website and check it.here i am attaching the screenshot,

Abdul Razaq,Best product to scam Indian youths!,1,12-Aug-22,1. Don't buy this product. Its fake. Company claims 25g protein but lab reports by many youtubers shows 14-15g (you can check youtube).2. I've been using since 5 months. But no results.3. Recent one which I bought had foul smell and bad taste compared to earlier purchase. Even mixability was not good. After consuming I experienced food poisoning. Even my friends experience the same. So I contacted the BigMuscles  through mail for replacement/return. Its been a month and no reply from their side even after 4 mails from me.After that I watched many youtube reviews on this product. Finally realized I'm scammed.If you value your health don't go for this product.,

Saransh Yadav,Horrible belgian chocolate ever!!!,2,15-Nov-21,"Here are the list of things wrong with this Whey :-1. Mixbility- take out a scoop and put it in the glass and add water and you can see lumps and lumps floating on water. Poor mixbility, have to really shake in the gym shaker too to have consistency.2. Taste - horrible ever tasted whey in my life. Tastes like rotten chocolate milk, with extra sweetness.3. Effectiveness - been using for  few days now, forget about feeling it in the muscles after a long strenuous workout, I doubt it doesn't even give you the required bcaas or other claimed nutrition as on label of this whey.Lets not be fooled by R Singh endorsement and buy this. Its a garbage product. They are high on marketing and zero on product research and development. Big Muscle should consider putting more on product betterment than getting endorsements by A listed stars. At the end its the consumers who need to be happy not your bollywood celebs.",

It supplements your food and not an alternative. Its not magical and wont work without proper nutrition from real food. Dont over consume it as it may affect your kidney. Drink lots of water.

Suryapratap,One of the best for intermediates,3,3-Nov-21,"I'm using this product for about 1 year or more. I can say that this brand is working hard to improve there products. When I started using it, it was the most adorable whey protein which also tastes good. Considering the results, if it's pure whey, irrespective of brand it will give you the results. It's a myth that results vary from brands to brands. Actually the quality varies from brand to brand which ultimately impacts results. Anyway, talking about this bigmuscle's whey, the advantages are it's affordable, tastes good, it's a blended Protein and most importantly we will rarely encounter fake or duplicate product. In some case I found the product suspicious, but no worries. I just replaced it easily.For beginners and intermediates, this is the perfect one I can recommend.",
Shushrut,BUY! BUY NOW!! KEEP BUYING THIS!!!,5,6-Mar-21,"By far the best protein drink I've had. It has the perfect flavour, perfect mixability and the perfect combo (since it comes with creatine).I've tried MB, Quista and Sinew, they all have an artificial taste for the chocolate flavour. But this one has the best taste of them all. It tastes very natural and doesn't have a medicinal smell.I needed to buy a shaker for Quista as it used to not mix properly, but you can mix this with a spoon as well. It tastes great and no additional sugar required.The fact that it's so cheap and also comes with creatine is unbelievable. Go for it if you find this anywhere below ‚Çπ1500.",
Neetesh sharma,I don‚Äôt trust the brand.,1,6-Jul-21,"Again i was lured by the aggressive pricing and thought of giving it as try, i intended to use it as my secondary source of whey but i don‚Äôt know for some reasons i have trust issues with the product.

I would stick to reputable brands only going forward.  Not using it anymore.",

Ali Mohsin Shaikh,High Quality Protein,5,13-Jun-21,Ordered this 500gm pack for try it first before ordering big one. Tried for 8 days now and will be ordering a big pack as i am fully satisfied. 25gm protein per serving is very nice. And it also have 5.5gm BCAA per serving. Best part is it have no added sugar. Also it has blend of Whey Protein Concentrate & Whey Protein Isolate unlike low priced protein which only have Whey concentrate. This is a high quality protein and also have a good price point. Also Rocky Road flavour is awesome.,

Mohammad Zain,What happens when you don't know anything about big muscles,1,28-Jul-22,When I bought this product first time it was quite good and then I thought to buy it again but the second time when I bought this Belgium chocolate flavour I was really upset because the mixbility was not so good and it has small pieces of stones in IT firstly ignore them I thought I am just being to careful but when I use this consequentively regularly the small pieces of stones are coming in every scoop i don't know what the guys are selling but I honestly honestly tell you to not to buy this product and don't get to greedy about the price because they are not selling what you guys are thinking.,
MADHURJYA PROTIM BORAH,"Good, Certified and pocket friendly",4,12-Dec-21,"Firstly coming to its taste, I ordered vanilla flavour everthing is fine but I found the sweetness bit more for me. IDK this may be because earlier i used their raw isolate whey. But in my point of the sweetness is more.2. Mixability is good.3. Packaging is good.But yes in the container they have not printed the labdoor stump idk is this because the product i received is from previous batch or its like this only any ways this is not my concern because I have gone through the report in labdoor site.3. Doesn't feel bloated.Its been 2 days after consuming for 1month i will update my review...",
Biryani Hut,Inefficient,1,9-Aug-20,"Mixability is not so good  but the major problem is lack of Digizymes.Hence not so easy for beginners or people who will be using whey for first time & may cause bloating.Big Muscle Taste is decent, packaging is good butDigestibility is truly not so efficient compared to other brands.Better go for ""My Fit Fuel Advance 100%""",
Samrat,"Disgusting flavour, it has a sickening aftertaste",2,5-Feb-21,"The taste is horrible. It has a sweet milky flavour which will make you feel sick after consuming it. I tried it with water and milk, both options were pathetic. I somehow drink it these days because I don't want my money to go to waste so need to finish it.Whether it helps in gaining muscle weight or not, that I can only tell after a month of consumption. Once my bottle is over, I'm never repurchasing it again. I'd rather go for Endura mass, even though comparatively it has lower protein content, atleast its taste is bearable.",
Customer,It doesn't have a normal texture like other proteins.,1,8-Jun-21,"I've tried most of the other proteins like Optimum Nutrition, MuscleBlaze etc. This one doesn't have the regular texture and is different from the ones I ordered. The powder is very free and spills everywhere. Only reason I bought it was because it was on offer. If you find it on offer and are going to buy it because it's cheap, DONT. switch to Scitron Raw, it's really cheap and also has 0 carbs",
nikhil,"Cheap quality protein, but OK at this price",1,9-Oct-21,"Don't go with soo much good reviews, it's just an Average protein in taste and effectiveness.The reason behind soo much good reviews is that in each packet,they send in this 100 rs cashback coupon, that you'll get after posting a good review and then sharing the screenshots at the given number.Go for it only if you have limited budget",
Ranapar,"Low solubility, My personal recommendation - avoid this whey",1,16 April 2021,"The product is overall nothing too great. Maybe Good for beginners considering competitive price range, however I would not recommend anyone to take this. Muscles will still be tired inspite of drinking this and as far as muscle growth is considered I would rate it at 1 star.....Solubility in water is very poor and it takes time and lots of stirring for the powder to dissolve. Overall summary- avoid this",
Amazon Customer,Quality needs to be improved,2,23-May-21,"This is my second purchase of BM whey protein but I feel that this time the product is different. It doesn't gets mixed properly with water or milk, forms lump everytime. I had purchased salted caramel flavour but it is not printed in the packet. It is just a sticker stuck to the packet which can be removed. So I really doubt if I received the genuine product this time.",
Sirii,Don't buy coffee flavour...,1,6-Aug-22,Don't buy the coffee flavour I have tried literally all the flavours of this whey...before 1 year caffe Latte use to be the best flavour of this way but now a days u can buy any flavour but don't go for caffe latte this doesn't taste like coffee at all.. My all time favourite is strawberry flavour..salted caramel and Rocky road are also good flavours i gave tried those also...i actually loved salted caramel..,
dev,Genuinely Fake!!!!!!,1,27-Dec-21,BigMuscles is one brand which I always trusted.... But this product is either fake or totally pathetic.... The taste is nothing close to Belgian chocolate.... Mixibility is pathetic...its floats on top and forms lumps.... That's a sign of fake protein..... Pls do not buy,
Piyush Chaurasia,Best Whey Protien Till Date,5,14-Feb-22,"The Big Muscles Whey Protein is the best whey protein i have ordered till date because of the mixability it offers is just amazing and it has a very good taste and texture of chocolate flavour . Best recommended after a workout with water and it helps to grow the muscles and repair them in a faster way , i have tried many other whey proteins in this price range but with my perception big muscles whey protein turns out to be the best in the price segment because of the quality of whey it offers is very good , i would recommend it to everyone , try it once and you would definitely like this product.",

Amazon customer care told me to contact BM directly.",
Brandon,Good price but quality isn't upto the mark.,3,30-Aug-21,"I was excited to receive this package because this was the 1st time I was trying a flavour other than chocolate whey. When I recieved it packaging and everything was great even the smell of the flavour was there, however once you mixed it or use your shaker the consistency of the protein becomes foamy and isn't thick even after using the recommended scoops and water too. I won't be ordering this flavour again unless this problem is resolved because I haven't faced this with other flavours or other brands as well. If you do order consider it an experiment which can result one of two ways.",
Amazon Customer,FAKE AND POTENTIALLY HARMFUL SUBSTANCE !!!,1,27 April 2021,"Fake product, had serious side effects just with 1 sip of this thing, it's definitely not whey protein.

verified purchaser shruti,pathetic quality,1,19-Aug-21,dont buy unless you want to drink sugar and milk powder. This product has paid reviews only! Worst quality protein. you can actually see dirt in the product . Just because it is little cheap doesn‚Äôt mean that it is worth buying. Rather don‚Äôt drink protein and take natural food . Again i repeat NOT WORTH IT.,
Pooja Srisrimal,Very bad flavor,2,29-Jul-22,"This brand is ver good for their protein powders and flavors. I really like the Belgian chocolate flavor but i decided to try another flavor and chose cookies and cream. The second i tasted it, i knew it was too sweet and didn‚Äôt sit right in my stomach. I ended up just chugging it all only to puke it out an hour later. I tried again later in the evening after my workout and the same happened. I drank it just to puke it out. And any other foods i had in the day didn‚Äôt upset my stomach like this shake. If you‚Äôre looking for a protein powder, this bran is really good but not the cookies and cream flavor",
Shivratna ingale,This protein gives only 13 gram protein in one scoop,1,9-Jul-22,This product is fake because i watched so many videos on YouTube about this protein... All YouTuber tested this in lab and their lab test say's very low protein in this product..... I got that answer why this product price is so low..... I will not buy again this protein and this company product.... If you are seeing this message BM then reply why the lab report showing low protein in the product...!!!!!!!!!!!!!,

Abhishek Tiwari,First Whey_Okay_Have nothing to compare it too,4,13-May-22,"Only add on I have to make is People complaining about it's sweetness.....Yes it is and it is not.Feels sweet and chip-Chipa when taken with milkFeels ok when taken with water...Also, some videos I have seen making fun of this brand using name Big Chustleas..... Telling it has Sugar and Malto Dextrin put in it.....i could not clarity over it..... So a bit confused even after using it....Regarding mixability, It seemed not to cause any problem... Atleast to me..... Depends on whether you put water and then powder or powder and then water... Or water powder and water.... Try whichever combo works",
Anu sharma,Not for everyone,2,4-Jun-22,It includes sucralose which is way more sweeter than refined sugar. It is too sweet to have it you don't consume high sugar quantity. It is not suitable for diabetes and people with insulin resistance or pcos. If you don't have any of these issues you can have it for muscle building or to fulfill daily protien need.,
Satyam M.,Excellent for Beginners,5,27 April 2022,Taste is excellent.Verified Purchase from BigMuscles Official Website.Also have tested MuscleBlaze product and it was ok ok.So I would recommend this over MB.Great with Milk but it takes a lil time to digest so take cold water instead and it blends easily.I take 1 Cup of Protein Powder1 Cup of Oats2 BananasSome Dry FruitsAnd grind them in mixer grinder with cold water and it tastes excellent.1Kg took me 2 Months to finish daily once after workout.And the result was pretty effective I would say. Just go for it. It won't disappoint. Bought this after a lots of research so I'm pretty happy.,
Harun,Tastes disgusting and soapy,2,26-Aug-21,"It does the job, absobancy and results are great, but the taste and texture is absolutely horrible.It tastes soapy and bitter and develops a lot of foam and it also makes whatever you mix with is extremely slimy and coats your throat in a weird way",

Viraj Gajare,Really Good Results,4,6-Oct-20,This product offers really good protein content at the price hence great results too.I did not suffer any digestion problems either.Really Value for Money and Great For People who want to meet their goals. The Flavour Can Be Better.,

Kush Rawat,best whey for recovery for beginners and best taste,5,6-Jun-21,"The media could not be loaded.
                
¬†Many of the potential benefits are based on single studies and more evidence is required before making definitive judgment.Whey protein is a mixture of beta-lactoglobulin, alpha lactalbumin, bovine serum albumin, and immunoglobins.Possible benefits include weight loss and lowering cholesterol.Possible dangers include nausea and headaches, but at moderate doses, whey protein is not considered dangerous. and for this big muscle give the premium whey gold adorable price and its rich taste make it delightful and it give help you in recovery and in my opinion my dean beginner go for it you can't get such a prefect whey protein in such price üòé‚úåüèª",
sunny12,I seen results in my muscles,5,19-Jul-21,I am doing gym from last 10 years. I am not a professional guy but I know the protein value and it's taste better.From long time I was used other company protein's from the advice of my gym trainer's.But in corona lockdown I planned to do the gym in home with my own dumbles and different protein. Someone my friend recommend this protein and I just buy it.Guys believe me this protein gave me good results as compared to last ten years. I don't know why my muscles are growing exactly Either this is due to this protein or my change of gym in home.But overall I noticed that this protein is good and you can achieve lean muscles without fat but if you do the good exercise only.,
Joshi,Excellent Product for all levels of gym goers at an affordable price,4,22-Oct-21,"I'm amazed after using this product because I've used products like ON, Muscle tech and MB but this one is nothing less compared to those brands and not to forget those brands are way too costly, almost double the price. I've chosen this product because of the brand BM nutrition which is highly recognized and Amazon offered it at a very low price. However, all my doubts got cleared after using it. I'm the proof that this product gave me excellent results combined with good workout volume and I could easily maintain my lean mass!Pros:- High brand value- Affordable price compared to other brands- Same results compared to other brands, provided your workout volume is good enough- No side effects- wonderful taste,I've tasted Belgian chocolate and Rocky road, both are superb!- Gives BCAA + Glutamic Acid with Whey protein, most brands have less or no amounts of these, it really helps in muscle recovery and repair- will last 30 days comfortably if taken 1 scoop per day- Absorbency is good, will see results in a week's time, again only with good workout volume and sufficient rest for bodyCons- mixing in a non shaker will take time(3-4 mins) but if you have a protein shaker, it only takes 10-15 secondsI would say, go for it and doesn't matter if you are a beginner or advance level gymmer! It's sure worth more than what we are paying for!",
Rishav pareek,Happy muscle üí™üí™,5,28 April 2021,I ordered this for my brother.he told me that plz Di ordered this for my I needed this. He just started going to gym few months back.

Rishi kapoor,Not satisfied with flavour,3,6-Oct-21,So I have been using big muscles products form a long time and they haven‚Äôt disappointed me. But this time I decided to order strawberry milkshake flavour and it was very bad. It doesn‚Äôt even close to strawberry flavour. I have used their many products and they are very good. But this strawberry flavour needs very much improvement otherwise the product is very good. You can go for the chocolate flavour but don‚Äôt order strawberry milkshake.,
Sreehari R.,Extremely disappointed,2,4-Jan-22,"Only good thing about it is that it tastes like a milk shake. Everything else is disappointing.On shaking, it foams up like beer and if you try to scoop it up, powder gets strirred up and gets mixed with air like dust. Easy to make you sneeze.You'd also burp a lot after drinking because of injesting too much froth.Not going to buy again",
unmesh m.,Good taste Good mixability powepacked,4,21-Jul-21,"The product is good. Overall I am satisfied with product. Good taste. Good mixability. And don't feel any bloating.

So I will post detailed review of muscleblaze, bigmuscle and ASITIS after a month.",
Pete,Value for money,5,6-Mar-22,"I ordered the strawberry flavour the taste is fantastic...i cannot say much of the product as ive completed only one month of use for the ones who wishes to use this for the first time ill say.The taste is just great,especially with cold milk, 2ndly the first week u will fart a little bit more due to the whey protein but after 1 week it goes away.I feel energised and i think my muscles are developing but i cannot for sure say if this is due to this or my workout routine in the gym...what i can say is that im happy with this product and my overall experience has been great so ive ordered 2kg chocolate flavour now and will write its review after again 1 month use...my thanks to Big muscles team...cheers",
Anshuman Mohanty,Solid Product | Subpar taste (Salted Caramel),5,17-Mar-22,"Pros:The absorbency quality is really impressive compared to competitors like Muscle Blaze.Cons:However, the taste of ""Salted caramel"" flavour is not up to the mark when compared to ""Belgian chocolate"". It has a hint of medicinal touch to it which makes it very bland.",
subhajeet Bhattacharya,good whey protein,5,12-Jan-22,"It's a good whey protein..The taste is amazingIt's authentic and it came with a scratch code with which you can verify the authenticity of this whey protein..However the results depend upon how you train and how much protein intake your body gets per day..I took two scoops per day, one scoop along with breakfast, one scoop after workout and sometimes one scoop at night but it's better you take casein at night because it's a slow digesting protein..You need to take the required amount of protein per day for Muscle Protein Synthesis so that your muscles can grow..So don't expect amazing results by just taking one or two scoops of this whey per day..Your diet must also include whole foods with good protein content along with this supplement..Foods like chicken breast, eggs, broccoli, pulses, cheese, yogurt, soya chunks, fish, nuts, peanut butter etc should also be taken along with this whey protein..If you do everything correctly, you will surely see the results like im seeing üî•",

But this time the consistency was different, more slippery and non sticky. It gave both me and my wife bad bloating and diarrhoea. The company should look into this, changing the brand now. It does not seem to be whey isolate this time, it seems to be just a concentrate with lots of lactose content.",
Goutham,Taste of flavor differs from the one ordered through company website,2,13-Aug-21,Brought this product last week. I have already purchased vanilla flavor from the company‚Äôs official website. But this time i brought it from amazon. I can feel the difference in taste. It makes me wonder if the sellers are diluting the vanilla flavour by adding filler substances. I Will never order this again from amazon. Please order directly from bigmuscle nutrition‚Äôs official website.,
nayim ali khan,DONT BUY!!! VERY BAD PRODUCT,1,22-Jul-21,I have been using protein powder for quite a while now. I have used BigMuscles earlier but now their quality has dropped drastically. The product forms an insane amount of froth which does not go away even after 5 mins of swirling which basically means either the product is spiked or the raw material used was the cheapest available. Please don't go for BigMuscles for now even if you are a regular customer as it's not the same.,
Suresh choudhary,Awesome Product taste and Benefits,5,1-Dec-21,"Awesome Product: First time ever i got this Super Protein Box. Too much delicious strawberry Flavor. Great Protein Supplement i ever purchased üòã. I m using it from five days and seeing good results in my body. Too much tasty flavour. You should try it. You will never forget its Taste and Benefits.Whey protein powder usually contains added flavours, as it doesn‚Äôt taste very appetizing by itself. If you are considering buying whey protein powder though, make sure that it doesn‚Äôt have added sugar.The protein content in it can easily supplement about 25-50 g of your protein intake. It‚Äôs an easy way for fitness enthusiasts, weight-loss hopefuls and other people, who lack adequate protein in their diet, to consume it. If you‚Äôve happened to try flavoured whey protein, you wouldn‚Äôt want to miss out on this protein source. You can add it to your protein bars and shakes, or have it as a meal replacement.I recommended u to please Use this Product and See it Benefits.",

Akshay Kale,Fake protein...go for muscleblaze fuel,1,1-Dec-21,1) From just the texture of the product the regular whey protein user will identify it is fake. Poweder is not at all like a whey.2) Even after drinking this protein you will not recover and will have body pain throughout the day with sleepy head. When I use Muscleblaze fuel I never get body pain post workout because protein content helps to recover the broken muscles. This thing has very low or near to zero protein content.,

Amit,Protein content has been spiked with nonesstial amino acid,3,20-Sep-21,Well it's protein content is 25 grm.but actual protein content is 8 to 10 grm per scoop .why I am saying this because when u will take test of these bigmuscles u will get accurate 25 grm of protein.but it's spiked method of mixing non essential amino acid so whenever to take any lab test of big muscles u will get satisfied with 25 grm of protein.but actuallt it's only 8 grm.these company are making fool to beginers.just watch fit muscle Gaurav Taneja has explained so well.  Its better to go with expensive or trusted brands rather than cheap brand.my protein they claim 25grm scoop 20 grm 100%protein .which is justified.and it's expensive.but yes those who can't afford expensive one can go with this.,
Atul T,Original,5,23-Mar-21,"This is the initial feedbsck. I'll revise it after finishing at least 50% of the quantity.So far so good.The best thing is that it's original.

Tried for two days during workout, can feel the difference.Thanks Amazon !",
Samay karani,Does it actually have 25gms protein ?,2,23 April 2021,"Maltodextrin is harmful, might increase your sugar level. Flavor is good, other than that the results that I'm getting are not satisfactory. I doubt that there is 25gms of protein in one scoop. Buy at your own risk.",

Gautam,Good Protein,5,16-Dec-21,"I am using this product from last 3 months and its results are really amazing, Flavor wise little strong but i like belgian chocolate ,easy to digest and no bloating issue. Super fast to dissolve. It is very versatile product as it can be used in many ways. But always prefer to mix in water and though the taste might feel bad first few times but you get used to the milky taste in it after two three days and start liking it. I love to drink it as it is more than any flavoured one. Go for it if you are on a budget and wanna drink good protein or you find it useless to spend on flavours.",

Himanshu,No labdor certification tag on the Box,3,11-Dec-21,"No labdor certification on the box. We can say that they are fooling us by the name labdor certification. On Amazon they mentioned labdor certification but when I recive the order, there is no labdor certification on the box. They need to fix this issue .

One is chocolate flavoured but another not contain chocolate flavour.After that I have bought 1 kg pack with Belgian chocolate flavour but it is not tested like chocolate even though it tested like without any flavour.This experience make me doubt on the product. Is it trusted? Are they give all nutritions listed on the product? I don't think so.,
Updesh Khandelwal,For low budget purposes,3,12 April 2022,It‚Äôs not good & bad also..if you dont have enough money to purchase higher end products than you can go for it.

Deepak Kumar Baresa,Can cause serious health issues,1,10-Jun-22,"Firstly I ordered Belgian chocolate flavour (from their official website)that taste ok (too much sweet) results were GOOD i was satisfied with product . Next time I ordered cafe latte flavour I don't know what was issue with product lot's and lot's of forth formation more forth formation than detergent powder I used product, that was big mistake I suffered from gastric issues with prolonged 4 months lots of medical expenses. Nausea,, gastric issues, indigestion can't have normal food for months . I can't trust BIGMUSCLE any more.",
Santosh K Rapaka,One of the worst protein powders in the market,1,3-Aug-22,Never buy this protein powder it's one of the worst protein powders available in the market. The company mentioned 24gms protein in scoop but where you get it tested from labs it's will hardly give 15gms protein in one scoop max. It's has digestive issues as well. Doctor choice and Big muscles are same brand under one company. This two companies are fraud don't fall prey to  that youtubers influencers and celebrities promote this brand because they get paid for that. Be careful it might damaged your kidney or liver in long run by using this cheap and low quality protein powders.,
Nitin Sarpal,Useless,5,21-May-22,"It is better to take natural diet rather than taking these protein shakes or supplements especially in INDIA which we don't know what's in there. It is better you eat well, exercise regularly to stay fit. Many of the protein products are abused in our country INDIA. They have written in the product that labdore tested. Labdore testing is not in INDIA. So many of the supplements companies can write anything because they know people wont be able to check the authenticity of the product anyway. Also we wont be able to check the bio availability of the product. Please beware before you buy any supplement in future.",
Mohd Ayyoob,Best flavoured whey protein you can get.,5,11-Jan-22,"I brought it's 2kg pack on 5 dec which costed 2818 i.e 1409 per kg and today is 10th of jan. On 5 dec my weight was 74.90 and on 10th jan my weight is 76.20. So yes it has definitely helped me gain muscles, considering i train every muscle twice a week. Since it is labdoor certified I had no trust issues buying this product.The flavour Belgian chocolate tastes good and is easily absorbed after 30 mins with no indigestion problems. I also used muscle blaze whey and I can say it tastes better than that. Though the muscle blaze whey gave better results than this. Anyways it was costly also at 1800 rs/kg.Therefore, i highly recommend this to anyone out there thinking of buying protein supplement. Today's it is priced at 1550 rs approx, still cheaper than competitions which are unflavoured in this range.",
Akash Singh,"Not worth it, protien content is much lower than what it's being clained",2,15-Sep-21,It very dissapointing... I have tested this protien in lab... and its only 47gm present in 100gm but the brand is claiming as 75gm per 100gm.I was using this since 2019..Please dont fall for lower price.,
aniket singh,Worst protein ever,1,25-Feb-22,Worst protein ever in my life ..protein percentange is 44% per 100gm üíîAs well as mixablity is very poor and the protein content is very very low . So i request Bigmuscle to stop making people fool üôè plz stoped it ASAP,
shwetank,BEWARE. DO NOT BUY,1,25-Aug-20,BEWAREDO NOT BUT THIS CHEAP PROTEINEVERY BATCH HAS DIFFERENT TASTE AND TEXTUREI ORDERED(BELGIAN CHOCOLATE-3RD TIME) FROM OFFICIAL WEBSITE AND RECEIVED AWFUL SMELLING SAND THIS TIME.I CHECKED ITS ORIGINAL BUT REALITY IS DIFFERENT.GO FOR ANY OTHER BRANDYOU CAN'T EVEN TASTE IT.CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS USELESS AND RUDE.CHEAP BRAND.Packaging is changed every month.This time no branding no sticker on the cap of jar.The vanilla flavour is so weird and synthetic.Also the texture is a little cakey or something wetty.you all are advised to avoid buying this flavour also.,
Nirav,Value for Money,4,18-Nov-21,I have been a regular ON user. but wanted to big muscles whey. I tried cookies and cream.1. 100% value for money .. 30% to 40 % cheaper then ON2. Cookies and cream taste was good. I am ok with sweet tastes. I liked it. Ordered same again3. absorbs well.. not the greatest. But works. Definitely it's thicker powder4. With milk can be tried.. texture is best then5. Functionally changing to big muscles did not result in any decline of energy or recovery. So I feel its on par with ON whey in terms of effectiveness.6. Packaging is premium.. with offers.. it becomes a sweet dealAll in all good value for money product,
MskTechCorp,Cheap Quality Product with Digestion issues,1,23-Sep-20,"I ordered it from their website only, I ordered Vanilla Creme Flavour But I got Delivered with Caffe Latte ( worst Flavour ) Worst Staff and services. Coming to Product review the Protein is Cheap Quality product and smells odd and bad when opened. After consuming 1st scoop I got Health issues like Vomiting, Diahrea, Disgestion problems. I stopped consuming with one scoop Only.As the price low as the Product Quality was low.And also Irregular heart beats with High blood pressure noticed after consuming this.Previously I had consumed many other brands but this one is worst Quality with occuring new health issues for a Healthy Person.See this Whey Protein Powder I ordered vannila Again, it's taste is like coffee, the Vanilla flavour also contains coffee, and sugar added, it's sweet too. Very cheap tricks made by company, Note :- Beware ...! not a good one for Health.",

Akshat,You have to try it if you are a beginner.,5,9-Nov-21,"Good absorbance and great taste. However, the Caffe Latte flavour is a bit better but this isn't bad either. Anyways, taste doesn't really matter if it can do what it is supposed to. Gives you a great pump, muscle recovery is amazing, and also helps in muscle soreness as well. All in all, a balanced combination of all the amino acids, whey and cals is great, and it gives you a good result in the end. Worth it!",

Mohit,Best protein,5,6-Oct-20,Best protein ever big muscles nutrition is the best indian brand company.I have such best results with this protein.,
Akshay desai ad,Best whey protein which comes in Belgian chocolate flavour,5,1-Nov-21,Tried it for over a week now .best chocolate flavour whey protein I have come across as I have tried few others as well.. so starting with packaging the packaging is superb and has a barcode to check the original product as there are very fake sellers out in the market..It each scoop has 25 grm protien per serving 5.5 grams bcaas . 4 grams glutamic and most important 0 grams sugar which makes it the perfect whey in it segment.. do give it a try,
Prakhar Verma,"Pick this one, best for the price.",5,20-Oct-21,After scouring the internet this product is the best I've found in the price range. The taste if really good and has good mixability as well. Whey is a natural form of protein so don't worry about safety as this is absolutely safe to consume. You definitely need a good workout before consuming this.I use water to make my protein shake but milk is fine too.Pro tip: Use a heaving teaspoon of coffee to add a nice nuance to the flavor.,
Ayush Nigam,Good Porduct but taste could be better,5,29-Oct-21,"Have been using for a month...ordered 500gm Belgian chocolate to try first..Wish cafe latte or vanilla flavour would available for 500gm. About flavour, it's okish could be better but who cares about taste when you look at product offerings with 0 sugar and 25g of protein for 35g of serving size..thats most important factor. Other brands don't provide that high protein contant per serving size..plus this product gives detailed amino acids content which is very good (which means this brand is not shy providing amino acids profile). Powder is dissolvable with little shake, no glums noticed which is good point. Plus no after affects like digestion problem faced which means quality product. Also manufacture date received was May 21. Overall satisfied with product but taste could be better. Its not aweful but not delicious",
Shanmugam,Great Taste and Convenient Packaging - Good for beginners,5,12-Oct-21,"I got this yesterday. It tastes good and very convenient to use as a post work out protein source. I received a 'small token of love' with the purchase and I really liked that idea; you give us a chance to connect back with you in a positive way and also get your product reviewed - a win win situation. That is actually an aspect of the purchase that I liked.1) The container is huge. You don't have to arrange a bottle or container to fill it; it is already filled in a spacious container. You certainly need more 'shelf space' to hold it. It has a label with complete details of all the amino-acids (protein components) present, with their quantity.2) The scoop is usually buried inside, which automatically happens because of the transport. I suggest the manufacturer to keep the scoop separate and easy enough to find; the little guy was playing hide and seek with me and gave me some trouble.3) The recommended usage is to use 180 ml water with one scoop of powder. But a lot of it sticks to the bottom and doesn't dissolve easily. This is probably the case with whey protein in general. But some tips to make it more homogenous drink is appreciated.To manufacturers: Consider including a small usage guide with the product. It may be a novel idea. Not everyone may be interested in consuming 25 grams of protein supplement in a single serving. A protein isolate is a life-saver. But general population lack the knowledge about the importance of protein for various health goals and the ease of supplementing it with a product like this.",
Yash,Good one @ great price,4,25-Oct-21,"Ordered first on great indian festival sale to check quality at low price and liked the product. Ordered second one after a week (got a review card through what i can get 100 cash back too. this is going to be the genuine review but just I wanted to Tu so you people that even you can get hundred rupees cashback on this cheapest product)Taste is good but I was worried about the extra sweet test that was shown in every review. on the contrary, I found it a little less sweeter than I used other expensive supplements like ISO sensation 93. mixability is good, taste is also somewhat good and you get this at very cheap price. I also saw some reviews in which they showed white dot kind of substance in powder. fortunately, I couldn't find it in any of my  jar. all over loved the product and should definitely given a try.",
Prashant,Does what it says,4,3-Nov-21,First of all its a good protein conc. and isolate in this price range. Not sure about the results yet but so far absorbency seems pretty good. Flavour's a okay too. Combined with a proper workout and diet it should just get the job done.,
Harpreeth,It‚Äôs very good and wonderful all the way,5,3-Nov-21,"It‚Äôs a great product for the start of the workout freaks , THERE I AM 6.6""HEIGHT ANDI AM USING IT'S ONE SCOOP IN POST WORKOUT AND ANOTHER IN EVENING CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH MY GAINING PERIOD,I AM GETTING BETTER RESULTS THEN I EXPECTED.

Andy Rox,Value for money Product,5,14-Oct-21,"They said under the cap that if we write a review on Amazon we get Cashback. But no cashback is received. This is all marketing strategy to increase Rating of the product.Talking about the Product now, it's just ok, I think this is a value for money product as It is quiet cheap so we can't expect expensive quality anyway.",
ROBERT M KUNJU,Best Ever considering the Price.,5,23-Oct-21,"First of all, I noticed the canister was almost full to the top with product. You cant even get a bag of chips that full anymore. The canister is also huge. Much bigger than my more expensive protien that only came half full. So right off I was impressed. I got the Chocolate and it smelled heavenly. I wasn't sure how good it would taste, but upon mixing it with unsweetened Almond Milk was pleasantly surprised. I had no issues with it mixing. I really bought this to bake with and also have been happy with those results and really liked it as well. I highly recommend this product.",
mrunalini,"Definite results, no bloating, easy to digest.",5,10-Oct-21,"It is 100% worth the money. This wehy protein is easy to digest, doesn't cause any bloating issue. Taste good and creamy.

It comes with bar code that you can scan and check authenticity. In the end; it is a great product.",
Jitender gautam,Good product to begin with,5,9-Nov-21,"5 star ratings are absolutely justifying for this product. I have been using bigmuscles whey protein for last 2 months, and this was my first time i used any protein supplement. I gained 7+ kgs in two months, ofcourse you will have to do excercise for atleast 1 hr and have to take a healthy diet with this. I was taking 4 bananas, 4 eggs and two times protein shake in a day. But results are absolutely visible. If you are beginner then you must chose this protein because you are gonna digest it very easily, and results are absolutely visible.",
Tushar Mane,Very good product,5,31-Oct-21,I have been using expensive whey proteins. One friend suggested Big Muscle proteins. I was skeptical about this initially.. but when I ordered this product.. I got the product in perfect condition. When I started using this product.. I found that this product matches the expensive and imported protein powders. I purchased Strawberry flavor. I found this has great taste. It dissolved very easily in milk. It gives good results.Thanks to Big Muscle team for producing this excellent in much lesser price.,
Mohammed Muzaffar Hussain,Personal Experience using the product.,5,15-Nov-21,"It's been 6 months using this brand product.Gained muscle mass/weight somewhat around 2kg - 3kg and for lean bulking a healthy diet and enough protein is necessary.For my protein intake i use chicken, veggies and protein supplements ( Isolate, blend and concentrate ( off days ) ) Basically i usually consume unflavored raw isolate protein but tried using the new flavors of Big-Muscles Nutrition Protein. I personally suggest if you are a beginner start using with flavors and make an hand on protein supplements later you can explore more things.In conclusion, I can say, best supplement in good friend of budget.",
SOVARAN SINGH,Nice product,5,22-Oct-21,"Purchased this product recently and The product is really amazing i just wanted a protein powder which tastes good and not like soil ( earlier i had) so the taste is chocolaty and since sugar is added, I don't need to add it manually so it's just ready to drink Powder.This product has some Essential Amino Acids which are rarely available in our diet . So i would recommend this to every gym lover and body enthusiastic peoples. Some people found that sugar content is high but it's not it is just for balancing sugar between powder. Overall good combo. Thanks.",

Thinking to switch to his brand only as it is cheaper too!",
SAHIL SETHI,Loved the flavor,5,14-Oct-21,I have been using big muscles products since 2 years. I am using this protein for the second time. Protein is good around 33 gms of scoop will give you 25 gms of protein. I loved the cafe latte flavor and i have also bought strawberry flavor.,
Channabasava R Madari,Read the review before buying.,1,4-Feb-21,"Maybe it has good offer or provides free creatine, but DON'T BUY IT.Packaging and branding over the box is so cheap. The label is rolled over the box like it's done with the hand.It looks nothing like the one in image.That powder inside smells great, tastes great but it's all milk powder enhanced. That protein content is really low.I got this for Rs.1000 with a free creatine. How can anyone produce 1kg of whey protein for just 700.The lab report given by some youtubers such as 20kgdown, Allaboutnutrition found this had only 12g protein scoop i.e., half of what has been claimed. And 18g/scoop in some batches. Many other youtubers found the same but they later removed their video from YouTube when the company paid them to do so.So most of the reviews on youtube are paid by the company.Other options available in same price range such are MB Fuel one or SINEW whey conc. 79I just want other beginners like me to not get cheated and be able to choose the right product for their price. Good luck.",64
Sahlaik Ahmad,Worst protein.,1,3-Aug-20,"Guys don't buy it! It doesn't tastes good, moreover not even close to expectations! It's way more costly too however it's garbage. You can buy GNC bolt that is much better than this. It's overhyped and it's terrible seriously trust me you will hate it....I want to return and get refund however Amazon says we are sending someone to pickup however no one came so far after 4 attempts. They will ignore your concern and you will end up loosing your money.",63
abhiman,"Low protein per scoop, but very good VFM",4,7 April 2020,The protein is marketed as isolate but it contains a lot of carbohydrates. Also the mixability is quite bad.I can excuse the mixability because at this price getting a genuine protein is good enough. But the company should not mislead customers by tagging this as an isolate.,113

¬†Unfortunately I‚Äôve been using bigmuscle product since last 2-3 months because I ordered a 2kg and 1kg pack together and it was the biggest mistake of my life. Upon mixing the powder with water it forms a lot of froth and almost 3/4th of the powder turns into the froth and then you have to wait for at least 30 mins for froth to settle down. And I was not getting any visible result using this product so i did some research and found that the labdoor has revoked their certification. So i got curious and saw some videos on YouTube where most of the people did the lab test of the protein and found that this powder only provides 30-40%(10-14g per serving of 35gm) of protein on dry basis whereas it claims almost 71% protein on there label. Maybe this is the reason labdoor has revoked there certification. I hope my review helps you to decide whether to buy this product or not.",23

Really unhappy with amazon.,1

Krishnov chakravorty,Product review!,5,18-May-22,"First of all the taste of the protein!So I bought Belgian chocolate flavor 2kgs ,First of all I opened my LetsVeriFy app and was kinda skeptical from the packaging of the product but when I scanned the Barcode and wrote the 5 number pin on the lid it was valid and 100% real ,Then the taste I‚Äôll give it a 7.5 out of 10 it was good there were so lumps in my protein so that was good ,no side effects or indications of diarrhea!But if you are lactose intolerant then I‚Äôd prefer u guys to have the protien with water instead of milk !So overall I‚Äôll give the protein 9/10..Should You buy it?Hell yes!Worth every penny!..Is the product real?Most of them are real but if you are skeptical just scan before u open the product if it‚Äôs not return it!but it always comes real tbh!..Any side effects?Nah..Ignore all the negative reviews all the negative reviews are from ppl who just started bodybuilding and expect quick growth!Been doing bodybuilding from the past 7 years so trust me this protein is worth it!",1
Suryapratap,One of the best for intermediates,3,3-Nov-21,"I'm using this product for about 1 year or more. I can say that this brand is working hard to improve there products. When I started using it, it was the most adorable whey protein which also tastes good. Considering the results, if it's pure whey, irrespective of brand it will give you the results. It's a myth that results vary from brands to brands. Actually the quality varies from brand to brand which ultimately impacts results. Anyway, talking about this bigmuscle's whey, the advantages are it's affordable, tastes good, it's a blended Protein and most importantly we will rarely encounter fake or duplicate product. In some case I found the product suspicious, but no worries. I just replaced it easily.For beginners and intermediates, this is the perfect one I can recommend.",1
Shushrut,BUY! BUY NOW!! KEEP BUYING THIS!!!,5,6-Mar-21,"By far the best protein drink I've had. It has the perfect flavour, perfect mixability and the perfect combo (since it comes with creatine).I've tried MB, Quista and Sinew, they all have an artificial taste for the chocolate flavour. But this one has the best taste of them all. It tastes very natural and doesn't have a medicinal smell.I needed to buy a shaker for Quista as it used to not mix properly, but you can mix this with a spoon as well. It tastes great and no additional sugar required.The fact that it's so cheap and also comes with creatine is unbelievable. Go for it if you find this anywhere below ‚Çπ1500.",1
Neetesh sharma,I don‚Äôt trust the brand.,1,6-Jul-21,"Again i was lured by the aggressive pricing and thought of giving it as try, i intended to use it as my secondary source of whey but i don‚Äôt know for some reasons i have trust issues with the product. There is this pungent chemical smell whenever you open lid of the box. Couple of times i used it and you may call it mere coincidence but stomach some what revolted.  I would stick to reputable brands only going forward.  Not using it anymore.",2

Also it has blend of Whey Protein Concentrate & Whey Protein Isolate unlike low priced protein which only have Whey concentrate. This is a high quality protein and also have a good price point. Also Rocky Road flavour is awesome.,1

BRD,Not Recommended at all,1,22-Jun-20,"First of all I got the caffe late flavour even when the outside box mentioned that it was chocolate flavour, and it is too sweet because it has artificial sweeteners in it, it's also mentioned on the container, but seeing the amount of sweetness, the sweetness is just too much, the quality is just unreliable as they are putting wrong flavour in wrong container, it also has other filling ingredients. Won't buying it again for sure.",2
Ved,Worst protein,5,22-Feb-22,"This protein is not whole claimed protein they advertise on label.  This is more of a gainer.  They are making people fool, I have used this protein continuously for 5 months until I realized through one person I training, not able to lose weight.  As I asked her to stop protein and in one week she lost 3 kg.  This is purely a weight gainer.  If you want protein then look for some other brand but not this.",1

Dennis Roberts,Do Not Buy This,2,22-Mar-21,Do not buy this product its not good. First of all don't buy whey concentrates because it'll be harder for you to digest and this product is partially whey concentrate and gave me stomach ache and bad cramps. Although your gut will adapt to it but still this tastes bad as poor flavor has been used. The mixability is really bad.PS - don't buy Whey concentrates. I am not going to buy any big muscles product again.,2
Suhrid Mukherjee,‚ùå Worst product ‚ùå,1,29-Nov-21,I was buying this product since 2 years.

Bhupesh Nagar,Taste not good,1,12-Sep-21,"Starting from the taste it is not at all good rather one of the worst I have tasted, you will taste a bit of milk powder. Mixibility is also bad after 1 minute of shake it still have lumps stuck with the shaker.

Biryani Hut,Inefficient,1,9-Aug-20,"Mixability is not so good  but the major problem is lack of Digizymes.Hence not so easy for beginners or people who will be using whey for first time & may cause bloating.Big Muscle Taste is decent, packaging is good butDigestibility is truly not so efficient compared to other brands.Better go for ""My Fit Fuel Advance 100%""",4
Samrat,"Disgusting flavour, it has a sickening aftertaste",2,5-Feb-21,"The taste is horrible. It has a sweet milky flavour which will make you feel sick after consuming it. I tried it with water and milk, both options were pathetic. I somehow drink it these days because I don't want my money to go to waste so need to finish it.Whether it helps in gaining muscle weight or not, that I can only tell after a month of consumption. Once my bottle is over, I'm never repurchasing it again. I'd rather go for Endura mass, even though comparatively it has lower protein content, atleast its taste is bearable.",2
Customer,It doesn't have a normal texture like other proteins.,1,8-Jun-21,"I've tried most of the other proteins like Optimum Nutrition, MuscleBlaze etc. This one doesn't have the regular texture and is different from the ones I ordered.

nikhil,"Cheap quality protein, but OK at this price",1,9-Oct-21,"Don't go with soo much good reviews, it's just an Average protein in taste and effectiveness.The reason behind soo much good reviews is that in each packet,they send in this 100 rs cashback coupon, that you'll get after posting a good review and then sharing the screenshots at the given number.Go for it only if you have limited budget",1
Ranapar,"Low solubility, My personal recommendation - avoid this whey",1,16 April 2021,"The product is overall nothing too great. Maybe Good for beginners considering competitive price range, however I would not recommend anyone to take this. Muscles will still be tired inspite of drinking this and as far as muscle growth is considered I would rate it at 1 star.....Solubility in water is very poor and it takes time and lots of stirring for the powder to dissolve. Overall summary- avoid this",1
Amazon Customer,Quality needs to be improved,2,23-May-21,"This is my second purchase of BM whey protein but I feel that this time the product is different.

Brandon,Good price but quality isn't upto the mark.,3,30-Aug-21,"I was excited to receive this package because this was the 1st time I was trying a flavour other than chocolate whey. When I recieved it packaging and everything was great even the smell of the flavour was there, however once you mixed it or use your shaker the consistency of the protein becomes foamy and isn't thick even after using the recommended scoops and water too. I won't be ordering this flavour again unless this problem is resolved because I haven't faced this with other flavours or other brands as well. If you do order consider it an experiment which can result one of two ways.",1

verified purchaser shruti,pathetic quality,1,19-Aug-21,dont buy unless you want to drink sugar and milk powder. This product has paid reviews only! Worst quality protein. you can actually see dirt in the product . Just because it is little cheap doesn‚Äôt mean that it is worth buying. Rather don‚Äôt drink protein and take natural food .

Highly suitable for beginners.",2
Anu sharma,Not for everyone,2,4-Jun-22,It includes sucralose which is way more sweeter than refined sugar. It is too sweet to have it you don't consume high sugar quantity. It is not suitable for diabetes and people with insulin resistance or pcos. If you don't have any of these issues you can have it for muscle building or to fulfill daily protien need.,1
Harun,Tastes disgusting and soapy,2,26-Aug-21,"It does the job, absobancy and results are great, but the taste and texture is absolutely horrible.It tastes soapy and bitter and develops a lot of foam and it also makes whatever you mix with is extremely slimy and coats your throat in a weird way",2

But this time i brought it from amazon. I can feel the difference in taste. It makes me wonder if the sellers are diluting the vanilla flavour by adding filler substances. I Will never order this again from amazon. Please order directly from bigmuscle nutrition‚Äôs official website.,1
nayim ali khan,DONT BUY!!! VERY BAD PRODUCT,1,22-Jul-21,I have been using protein powder for quite a while now. I have used BigMuscles earlier but now their quality has dropped drastically. The product forms an insane amount of froth which does not go away even after 5 mins of swirling which basically means either the product is spiked or the raw material used was the cheapest available. Please don't go for BigMuscles for now even if you are a regular customer as it's not the same.,1
sid,Talcum powder,2,25-Sep-21,Previously I ordered Belgium chocolate flavour.i tried this one and don't want to try any other flavours after this.the texture is just lik talc powder in this where as texture in Belgium chocolate was absolutely fine.,1

Akshay Kale,Fake protein...go for muscleblaze fuel,1,1-Dec-21,1) From just the texture of the product the regular whey protein user will identify it is fake. Poweder is not at all like a whey.2) Even after drinking this protein you will not recover and will have body pain throughout the day with sleepy head. When I use Muscleblaze fuel I never get body pain post workout because protein content helps to recover the broken muscles. This thing has very low or near to zero protein content.,1

Samay karani,Does it actually have 25gms protein ?,2,23 April 2021,"Maltodextrin is harmful, might increase your sugar level. Flavor is good, other than that the results that I'm getting are not satisfactory. I doubt that there is 25gms of protein in one scoop. Buy at your own risk.",2

So this led me to think, if its ingenuine, then i checked the code which said its original.Rest of the review will follow as I use it for some days.‚??‚??This part is after using it for some weeks-Very nice product. No lumps, easily moxes with a spoon. Taste is great. Easy to digest. No bloating. Will definitely use it again.‚??‚??‚??This part is after trying normal choclate, then vanilaa which was a lot of sugar. And then the worst experinece choclate fudge- only for choclate fudge, i didnt verify the genuine ness , hoping that thelast 2 products were genuine and so would rhis be.Thisis all together a different issue..i regret not checking the genuinesee..this one is way too sweet and plus forms lumps a lot of them and doesn‚??t mix at all, i eat the lumps..DONOT go for choclate dudge, and all of flaours, there was a small hole on the packaging, which i thought could be for ventilation, but orher reviews said, that it is a counterfiet product.Its been many months, i am unable to finish this choclate fudge, because it is very bad.My mother occassinally would share protein shake with me, bit this is very very very sweet. No body enjoys it.",13
Winter Soldier,Choco fudge > strawberry,4,25-Jul-20,"Though I personally feel, choco fudge is way better than strawberry flavor , however this is the best supplement for beginners and intermediate fitness enthusiasts.This flavour is Gluten free, but relatively higher cholesterol levels. Initially it tasted more like bubble gum than strawberry but I think my taste receptors aren't that efficient. However comparing this with my previous choco fudge whey, this makes a lot of froth/foam with cold water in the shakes, which settles after few minutes. Anyhow flavor have least priority for myself.  I combine this whey with muscle tech creatine and glutamine, which results in super gains and strength. After this stack is over , I'll definitely go with the GNC amp series whey along with creatine only.Thanks and happy Lifting ‚ù£Ô∏è",14

So the product delivered is original.Taste is really nice.. chocolate fudge. mixing with water and milk is good too. Here is the interesting thing i want to share. When you take it water it gets absorbed quickly. But when you mix water and milk together it takes really long time to get digested entirely. i did some test like mixing only with water then only with milk then mixing all three, the best results i got from water. So milk is a no go.Overall its a good product and i would recommend it for both beginners and experts. Hope this helps.",8
Dipankar S.,"Not mixable, protein floats and sticks in sipper",1,13-Mar-19,This product is useless. It does not mix at all with water after much trying. Chunks of protein floats in the sipper/ any container and sticks with them. However the sample which is 100% whey gold advanced series by gnc - that perfectly mixes with water. What a tragedy. I initiated refund and return on the same day. Next day someone from Amazon picked it up and I got the refund. So thumbs up to Amazon service and thumbs down to guardian healthcare or whether sells this product of gnc - either useless or fake product,21
Vijay Kedia,Waste of money !!,1,11-Mar-21,"This is not imported from US but made in India.

Ishan Thakur Das,Best protein!,5,8-Dec-20,"I've been using GNC protein powder for years in the UK, one of the best out there. In India i find most of the protein powders bein fake or horrible so this is the best protein to try in India. Go for it!!",9
Sammy,Perfect for low budget holders,3,29-Oct-20,GNC is an forgein brand but the manufacturing takes place in india . It taste much better then labrada which is also in same range and manufactured in india . Luckily I recieved an orginal product and you can easily check the autheticity of this product by scratching the code and entering in GNC website to verify .Taste is kinda sweeter but atleast its not bitter so you can drink it easily in water and in milk it taste even better .57 servings for 3.3k is quite good . Best suited for people who want a good protein under 4k.,7
Ruptanu P.,Not impressive,2,21 April 2021,"The flavour is definitely on the sweeter side. To comment on the effectiveness of the protein, for me, it had the same results compared to other cheaper brands like Asitis and Musclexp. On the contrary, the protein is heavier to digest, which for me was the biggest issue. Whey is usually something which should be quick and easy to digest. Also, the amount of protein per serving, 24gms per 35gms scoop, is relatively very less as compared to other brands. GNC should definitely work on improving their products as there are far more better alternatives in the market which have better quality and results even at a cheaper price.",6

GNC could have provided one shaker with the protein tub ...",8

Thank You amazon.Taste of chocolate fudge (with milk) is really really good.You will not even feel that you are having whey protein , the taste with milk is even better than ordinary chocolate icecream shakes and it is very thick also.I was using NutraBay product before buying this and I had good results with NutraBay too , I will update this review after 1 month usage of GNC.But the inital impressions are really awesome !",6
Asutosh S.,Tastes Terrible and Synthetic,2,22-Mar-19,"I have been a consumer of this protein for many years and used to love it. Earlier they would import this from the US and now they manufacture it in India. I am shocked how a company like GNC hasn't been able to maintain product consistency in their product. The Indian made product tastes very synthetic and nothing like the original thing. For a while, I didn't even know I had bought the original thing or not. But GNC confirmed it is. So I dunno if I will continue with this or just switch to a protein that doesn't taste this plastic. I am sure there are some compromises made to make the price affordable. Wouldn't recommend if you believe in quality.",8
RAJAT CHAUHAN,Should not order protein from amazon,1,2-Jan-21,"The gnc protein is excellent protein but the problem lies in the delivery. Amazon delivers damaged item like product with broken seal, instead of protein there will be something else. And you will face problems on return also.Clear advice is you should not buy protein on online platforms. Go to nearest store and buy it.",8
Harshit Narula,Excellent product best for muscle gaining,5,13-Feb-20,Excellent product. Best for muscle gaining it's very easy to mix unlike other whey protein.Using this product from last week and I'm amazed from the resultsGrate tasteDo take in water after gym for best results,76
Yash,No scoop inside how will I measure the about ?,3,5-Jul-22,"Useless seal. Doesn't hold the package from getting opened.Small dot hole in the seal, not sure why that is there.Worst part is, the container doesn't have scoop inside it. How am I supposed to measure the quantity of the amount that I'm taking ? Pathetic!!But scratch code does work. First i messaged them, i didn't got the response but after 5 mins  i checked on webside and it said the product is already been verified and the previous verification details was of mine only, that i did 5 mins ago. So the Scratch code does work!The container is bigger than the amount of protien in it. Hense looks half empty but weight seems to be as promised by GNC.It is Indian protein. Manufactured by Tirupati Wellness Private Limited, Surajpur.Will update the review after one month of consumption.",3
Kindle Reader,Poor Quality,1,26-Aug-21,"I bought GNC Pro Performance 100% Whey Protein - 2 kg (Chocolate Supreme) on 3-Aug-2021  which was sold by the vendor Cloudtail India on Amazon. The Guardian Authentication Code is UBBPY5GP. It came in proper packaging, the top was sealed, I scratched the code and it looked authentic except for one major issue that it is ""too sweet to drink"".I have bought this product 3 times now, really liked the first two times, and never experienced such a sweet protein powder before. It tastes bad with so much sweetness. The issue can be either it is fake or the product quality has got deteriorated. In either case, I'm not buying it again.",2
anita,Best whey protein,5,3-Mar-20,It's a pack of best chocolate flavoured protein.I purchased this protein for myself.Its taste is amazing and I was expecting the same.Trust me it's one of the best protein available in the market.,9
Jayram Gowda,Best in the price!!,5,24-Feb-21,Best whey protein in budget just go for it and in these reviews they have mentioned about the hole in the seal it's a technology provided by the company so that the box doesn't get damaged while transportation go for it I've got good results too,5
A.Sai Prathap,Recommended,4,24-Jul-21,Review after usage of 20days its good protein blend and getting results. It is super sweet. I couldn't able to drink banana shake cause of super sweet after adding this protien. Drinking this protien by mixing with 300ml water even it sweeet.Overall its good  protein getting nice results. Recommended protien.,3
Satyaki sanyal,GNC whey protein product review,4,14-Mar-21,"Hi,I started to workout seriously after a long span of 5 years.I have used whey protein from Ultimate nutrition and Muscletech and can say that the flavouring and texture of this product is at par. Now,coming to recovery,I can say that protein consumption and fish oil consumption reduces soreness overall but to see some changes in the mirror , it definitely takes a long time.Regards,Satyki Sanyal",4
neelam,"Too sweet, doesn‚??t mix well",3,16-May-22,"I‚??ve been using ON Whey Isolate for a long time and decided to try GNC to switch things up. Found GNC to be much sweeter- sweet enough to give me a sugar rush. Not very palatable. Also I noticed that it doesn‚??t mix as easily as ON does. While it is much cheaper than ON, I feel it is not worth the money saved. Will go back to ON after finishing this.",3
Keshav Mohta,Authenticity,1,8-Feb-20,The received product couldn't be verified by GNC website so either the product is FAKE or the code/audenticity verification by GNC doesn't seem to work. In all I don't know if the product is genuine and thus it can be harmful.,9
Raj,Wonderful product,5,20-Oct-20,"The product exactly delivers whats written in the box, I could see significant change in my muscle size and also increase in power while using the product.

Joseph Jacob,Satisfied,5,19 April 2021,"I have seen many people saying that the lid has a hole in it but believe me that hole is not by amazon that hole in the lid has been provided by the company. I have been in the fitness industry since past 3 years and to be true gnc provided me with the best results in these years. Good taste, Good results and better quality of muscle growth.",4
Rahul,Whey protein isolate,4,25-Oct-19,It is not same as the one which I bought in overseas.. Taste is same but the thickness is missing. Worthy and flavour is good.,8
Amazon Customer,Its not worth GNC brand,1,13 April 2022,I tried GNC because of someone's reference and i need to shake it for almost 15 min and then also it doesn't mix well.I contacted manufacturer and they also didn't respondwd the way they should i sent the video of shaking and the lums inside he said even i can't mix it this much well and he said this is perfect .I threw it its completely waste don't buy.,2
Ashish,TOO SWEET AND HEAVY BUT PERFORMANCE IS GOOD.,3,26-Jun-21,I do not like taste of choclate fudge because it's too sweet. It's too heavy after mixing it with water that's why I didn't try to consume it with milk.Protien is okay in this budget. Performance is good I can see muscularity in my body. Product is genuine because I have checked authencity through various platforms.,2
kapil,Authentic product as verified via GNC site,1,9 April 2021,"The product is authentic but if I compare it with the chocolate flavors which i have used several times. Adding a similar amount of scoop in water, the chocolate flavor holds the thickness and this strawberry doesn't.Definitely not expected from GNC, the product is definitely authentic (Manufactured -Mar 21) also the powder doesn't seems to be fresh .My advise is to stick to flavours which are widely verified and accepted by the consumers .A BIG NO TO CREAMY STRAWBERRY FLAVOUR by GNC",1
Anil Kumar Dubey,Nice strawberry flavor,5,28-Jan-22,"Nice flavor and taste. I have tried a large number of brands and this is one of the best. Must for post workout. Replace fatigue catabolic state body with anabolic state. Also consume carbs with good fats after workout to cover energy need. I will recommend this brand due to its price, quality and flavor. Must give it a try.",64
Kunal Dey,A good blended whey with great taste,5,2-Feb-21,Great tasting protein with good mixability. Result is also very good. This was my 4th buy of gnc pro performance whey 100%. It actually gives good result to gain lean muscle mass.,3
Amazon Customer,Third class product- very bad quality,1,2-Jun-22,"The product is very very bad - the protien doesn‚??t dissolve properly, which shows the poor quality; very bad taste; and when I contacted Amazon for the same, they said talk to the vendor/merchant, wrote them 2 emails with pictures, been a month and no courtesy to even reply yet",1
Jeeps,Awesome protein tasteful & adequate quality,5,17-Mar-22,The rate of choco fudge flavour is dam good very tarty you can have it with chilled water or milk.

Anant Jain,Has maltodextrin in it.,1,18-Jun-22,One should be mindful when reading the ingredients. Manufacturers are getting smarter. The protein is extremely sweet because of maltodextrin in it. A complex form of sugar that spikes insulin in your body post consumption.,1

Verified_Amazon _Customer,Probably a duplicate,5,18-Feb-21,Should I be worried that a duplicate product is being sent? Look the bottle... no new packing looks torn like that.Deliberately given 5 stars so that helps make a conscious decision people and rethink of buying this,2
Amazon Customer,Causes gas,2,2-Sep-20,I would suggest to buy a protein with no flavour and that does not contain artificial sweeteners. This causes flatulence. Try unflavored protein,2
Girish,The taste could have been better,3,1 April 2021,It doesn't readily dissolve in milk. And also does not tastes very good but manageable. But the response team was very friendly. They told me they would help me return it but they replied a little bit late and I couldn't return the product. Anyways I had to consume it and it's satisfactory.,1
Dhvani,Taste is fabulous,5,16-Feb-21,I think its the best tasting whey ever.. it tastes like a creamy chocolate ice cream. Best taste among whey protien ever for a reasonable cost,2
Aritra,The product has changed. Photos of old product are shared to mislead people,1,16-Sep-21,The nutritional profile has changed. The new one contains 3gm sugar per scoop and tastes pathetically sweet. It is still being sold using the nutritional profile of what used to be good whey.,1

Srinivas Deverakonda,Most effective Whey protein supplement in India,5,24 April 2019,This was recommended by my personal trainer. I was using Optimum nutrition prior to this and found GNC to be better. It mixes well and I love the taste. GNC Pro Performance is the most effective whey protein both in terms of results and cost. And GNC have a very good product authenticity checking system via SMS which I was impressed with. Easy 5 stars.,
AJ,Good performance but too sweet!,4,12-Oct-20,"I have tried isolate by GNC before and obviously performance wise that is a little better.However, if we go by price per gm protein, pro performance is not a bad choice.The only let down for me is that it's too sweet! I mixed about a quarter of my old flavorless whey and still the sweetness is overpowering! Strangely it wasn't that sweet when I tried it about 6 months back. Maybe they tweaked it a bit to amuse Indian sweettooth like Coke in India.Nonetheless a good supplement whey in branded entry segment by one of the most trusted brand GNC!",
kulbir,Origional not fake,1,30-Oct-19,Fake product product code not matchPls take any step on this product otherwise i will case in high court on your company,
Amrut Nadgiri,Not a genuine,1,3-Oct-19,Even im the first the buyer this protein product..like everyone here said became true . Product was unsealed while delivering with no hologram sticker on it. It is my humble request to Amazon if you say we deliver genuine product than live up to that . Don't fool people or else apni dukan Soo will became fraud logo ki dukan.,
Amazon Customer,Punch hole in the inner layer sealing.,1,16-Feb-20,"Received the product on 16/02/2020. But the crucial point is that there's a punch hole type sealing in the inner sealing cover. Scratch label is still intact but presence of such a hole creates doubt of its authenticity. Other Genuine protein bands does not have such a punch hole and resealing. Very doubtful Product!!!!Edit: After 10 days of use I found it is the worst in terms of mixability or absorbency, does not mixes fully in water. Lumps are left behind.",
Puneet Badola,test is good thanks Amazon still in India we have genuine products,5,20-Feb-19,First time I am using GNC product I used almost every whey protein but with GNC is my first experience test is good and it's sugar free after hit my gym workout I used 1 scope and I feel a good recovery and so much energy I will share u my final review after 20 days then only I can say about the resultThe product is genuine and thanks AMAZON  for it,
Vardan Bansal,"100% fake whey, contains salt!",1,16-Aug-20,"I‚??ve been a regular user of whey for sometime now. Upon the recommendation of my gym trainer, I thought of trying GNC for the first time, albeit really scared.Got the product delivered on time, opened it, put a scoop of it in water to taste it, turns out all it tasted like was just pure SALT! Yes, you read it correct, whey protein tasted salty. Even the dry powder without water tasted salty.Never buying this product ever again. 100% fake product and not worth the hassle.",
Anmol Rai,It's a good whey protein..,5,16-Sep-21,"It's a good whey protein..The taste is amazing ""Chocolate Supreme""..It's authentic and it came with a scratch code with which you can verify the authenticity of this whey protein..However the results depend upon how you train and how much protein intake your body gets per day..I took three scoops per day, one scoop along with breakfast, two scoops with GNC Creatine after workout and sometimes one scoop at night but it's better you take casein at night because it's a slow digesting protein..You need to take the required amount of protein per day for Muscle Protein Synthesis so that your muscles can grow..So don't expect amazing results by just taking one or two scoops of this whey per day..Your diet must also include whole foods with good protein content along with this supplement..Foods like chicken breast, eggs, broccoli, pulses, cheese, yogurt, soya chunks, fish, nuts, peanut butter etc should also be taken along with this whey protein..If you do everything correctly, you will surely see the results..",
abhimanyu anilkumar,Just go for it.,5,15-Jul-20,"This is the second time I'm buying this product from Amazon. It's perfect. I really love it.

Hitesh Pant,Horrible choclate fudge- donot buy.,1,6-Sep-20,"Openend the package 5 minutes ago- As seen in the picture, the box is too big and the content is 1/4th less. So this led me to think, if its ingenuine, then i checked the code which said its original.Rest of the review will follow as I use it for some days.‚??‚??This part is after using it for some weeks-Very nice product. No lumps, easily moxes with a spoon. Taste is great. Easy to digest. No bloating. Will definitely use it again.‚??‚??‚??This part is after trying normal choclate, then vanilaa which was a lot of sugar. And then the worst experinece choclate fudge- only for choclate fudge, i didnt verify the genuine ness , hoping that thelast 2 products were genuine and so would rhis be.Thisis all together a different issue..i regret not checking the genuinesee..this one is way too sweet and plus forms lumps a lot of them and doesn‚??t mix at all, i eat the lumps..DONOT go for choclate dudge, and all of flaours, there was a small hole on the packaging, which i thought could be for ventilation, but orher reviews said, that it is a counterfiet product.Its been many months, i am unable to finish this choclate fudge, because it is very bad.My mother occassinally would share protein shake with me, bit this is very very very sweet. No body enjoys it.",
Winter Soldier,Choco fudge > strawberry,4,25-Jul-20,"Though I personally feel, choco fudge is way better than strawberry flavor , however this is the best supplement for beginners and intermediate fitness enthusiasts.This flavour is Gluten free, but relatively higher cholesterol levels. Initially it tasted more like bubble gum than strawberry but I think my taste receptors aren't that efficient. However comparing this with my previous choco fudge whey, this makes a lot of froth/foam with cold water in the shakes, which settles after few minutes. Anyhow flavor have least priority for myself.  I combine this whey with muscle tech creatine and glutamine, which results in super gains and strength. After this stack is over , I'll definitely go with the GNC amp series whey along with creatine only.Thanks and happy Lifting ‚ù£Ô∏è",

Neel Gangrade,I really like the Taste and its thickness,4,13-Mar-21,"I bought this product recently, came well packed as expected. i immediately checked the online for this authenticity. it passed the test. So the product delivered is original.Taste is really nice.. chocolate fudge. mixing with water and milk is good too. Here is the interesting thing i want to share. When you take it water it gets absorbed quickly. But when you mix water and milk together it takes really long time to get digested entirely. i did some test like mixing only with water then only with milk then mixing all three, the best results i got from water. So milk is a no go.Overall its a good product and i would recommend it for both beginners and experts. Hope this helps.",
Dipankar S.,"Not mixable, protein floats and sticks in sipper",1,13-Mar-19,This product is useless. It does not mix at all with water after much trying. Chunks of protein floats in the sipper/ any container and sticks with them. However the sample which is 100% whey gold advanced series by gnc - that perfectly mixes with water. What a tragedy. I initiated refund and return on the same day. Next day someone from Amazon picked it up and I got the refund. So thumbs up to Amazon service and thumbs down to guardian healthcare or whether sells this product of gnc - either useless or fake product,
Vijay Kedia,Waste of money !!,1,11-Mar-21,"This is not imported from US but made in India.

Ishan Thakur Das,Best protein!,5,8-Dec-20,"I've been using GNC protein powder for years in the UK, one of the best out there. In India i find most of the protein powders bein fake or horrible so this is the best protein to try in India. Go for it!!",
Sammy,Perfect for low budget holders,3,29-Oct-20,GNC is an forgein brand but the manufacturing takes place in india . It taste much better then labrada which is also in same range and manufactured in india . Luckily I recieved an orginal product and you can easily check the autheticity of this product by scratching the code and entering in GNC website to verify .Taste is kinda sweeter but atleast its not bitter so you can drink it easily in water and in milk it taste even better .57 servings for 3.3k is quite good . Best suited for people who want a good protein under 4k.,
Ruptanu P.,Not impressive,2,21 April 2021,"The flavour is definitely on the sweeter side. To comment on the effectiveness of the protein, for me, it had the same results compared to other cheaper brands like Asitis and Musclexp. On the contrary, the protein is heavier to digest, which for me was the biggest issue. Whey is usually something which should be quick and easy to digest. Also, the amount of protein per serving, 24gms per 35gms scoop, is relatively very less as compared to other brands. GNC should definitely work on improving their products as there are far more better alternatives in the market which have better quality and results even at a cheaper price.",
Avi Ashu,Good whey protein ...highly recommended for 3k budget,4,1-Dec-20,"Packing : well packedProduct : 100% genuine (just got for it )  , been in this fitness gym for the last 3 years and GNC protein is definitely good for lean muscle recovery and gains .Digestion : no digestion problem , no bloating , no acidity ...Taste : sweetness is well balanced and perfect . chocolate fudge is good ,better than vanilla or strawberry.Budget wise : best for the Indian market as compare to muscle blaze and other Indian products . GNC could have provided one shaker with the protein tub ...",

Sanjay Navik,Excellent product and remarkable delivery,5,5-Nov-18,Was looking for balance Whey protein with good nutrient content... after various recommendations and research I choose GNC.

Thank You amazon.Taste of chocolate fudge (with milk) is really really good.You will not even feel that you are having whey protein , the taste with milk is even better than ordinary chocolate icecream shakes and it is very thick also.I was using NutraBay product before buying this and I had good results with NutraBay too , I will update this review after 1 month usage of GNC.But the inital impressions are really awesome !",
Asutosh S.,Tastes Terrible and Synthetic,2,22-Mar-19,"I have been a consumer of this protein for many years and used to love it. Earlier they would import this from the US and now they manufacture it in India. I am shocked how a company like GNC hasn't been able to maintain product consistency in their product. The Indian made product tastes very synthetic and nothing like the original thing. For a while, I didn't even know I had bought the original thing or not. But GNC confirmed it is. So I dunno if I will continue with this or just switch to a protein that doesn't taste this plastic. I am sure there are some compromises made to make the price affordable. Wouldn't recommend if you believe in quality.",
RAJAT CHAUHAN,Should not order protein from amazon,1,2-Jan-21,"The gnc protein is excellent protein but the problem lies in the delivery. Amazon delivers damaged item like product with broken seal, instead of protein there will be something else.

Yash,No scoop inside how will I measure the about ?,3,5-Jul-22,"Useless seal. Doesn't hold the package from getting opened.Small dot hole in the seal, not sure why that is there.Worst part is, the container doesn't have scoop inside it. How am I supposed to measure the quantity of the amount that I'm taking ? Pathetic!!But scratch code does work. First i messaged them, i didn't got the response but after 5 mins  i checked on webside and it said the product is already been verified and the previous verification details was of mine only, that i did 5 mins ago. So the Scratch code does work!The container is bigger than the amount of protien in it. Hense looks half empty but weight seems to be as promised by GNC.It is Indian protein. Manufactured by Tirupati Wellness Private Limited, Surajpur.Will update the review after one month of consumption.",
Kindle Reader,Poor Quality,1,26-Aug-21,"I bought GNC Pro Performance 100% Whey Protein - 2 kg (Chocolate Supreme) on 3-Aug-2021  which was sold by the vendor Cloudtail India on Amazon. The Guardian Authentication Code is UBBPY5GP. It came in proper packaging, the top was sealed, I scratched the code and it looked authentic except for one major issue that it is ""too sweet to drink"".I have bought this product 3 times now, really liked the first two times, and never experienced such a sweet protein powder before. It tastes bad with so much sweetness. The issue can be either it is fake or the product quality has got deteriorated. In either case, I'm not buying it again.",
anita,Best whey protein,5,3-Mar-20,It's a pack of best chocolate flavoured protein.I purchased this protein for myself.Its taste is amazing and I was expecting the same.Trust me it's one of the best protein available in the market.,

A.Sai Prathap,Recommended,4,24-Jul-21,Review after usage of 20days its good protein blend and getting results. It is super sweet.

Satyaki sanyal,GNC whey protein product review,4,14-Mar-21,"Hi,I started to workout seriously after a long span of 5 years.I have used whey protein from Ultimate nutrition and Muscletech and can say that the flavouring and texture of this product is at par. Now,coming to recovery,I can say that protein consumption and fish oil consumption reduces soreness overall but to see some changes in the mirror , it definitely takes a long time.Regards,Satyki Sanyal",
neelam,"Too sweet, doesn‚??t mix well",3,16-May-22,"I‚??ve been using ON Whey Isolate for a long time and decided to try GNC to switch things up. Found GNC to be much sweeter- sweet enough to give me a sugar rush. Not very palatable. Also I noticed that it doesn‚??t mix as easily as ON does. While it is much cheaper than ON, I feel it is not worth the money saved. Will go back to ON after finishing this.",
Keshav Mohta,Authenticity,1,8-Feb-20,The received product couldn't be verified by GNC website so either the product is FAKE or the code/audenticity verification by GNC doesn't seem to work. In all I don't know if the product is genuine and thus it can be harmful.,

Amazon Customer,Its not worth GNC brand,1,13 April 2022,I tried GNC because of someone's reference and i need to shake it for almost 15 min and then also it doesn't mix well.I contacted manufacturer and they also didn't respondwd the way they should i sent the video of shaking and the lums inside he said even i can't mix it this much well and he said this is perfect .I threw it its completely waste don't buy.,
Ashish,TOO SWEET AND HEAVY BUT PERFORMANCE IS GOOD.,3,26-Jun-21,I do not like taste of choclate fudge because it's too sweet. It's too heavy after mixing it with water that's why I didn't try to consume it with milk.Protien is okay in this budget. Performance is good I can see muscularity in my body. Product is genuine because I have checked authencity through various platforms.,
kapil,Authentic product as verified via GNC site,1,9 April 2021,"The product is authentic but if I compare it with the chocolate flavors which i have used several times. Adding a similar amount of scoop in water, the chocolate flavor holds the thickness and this strawberry doesn't.Definitely not expected from GNC, the product is definitely authentic (Manufactured -Mar 21) also the powder doesn't seems to be fresh .My advise is to stick to flavours which are widely verified and accepted by the consumers .A BIG NO TO CREAMY STRAWBERRY FLAVOUR by GNC",
Anil Kumar Dubey,Nice strawberry flavor,5,28-Jan-22,"Nice flavor and taste. I have tried a large number of brands and this is one of the best. Must for post workout.

Jiten Bhardwaj,Amazon is the problem,3,15-Nov-21,This flavour is very good. For all members of family this can be taken. The only √≠ssue is 1 out of 5 times the taste when ordered from Amazon is a dull variant. In fact it dosent taste as original choclate fudge. So be prepared to get something you didn't exactly ordered. Else order from gnc and while they have their own negative points but atleast we will need to depend on trust that what they are giving Is atleast original.,

Bhanu,Awesome,5,12-Sep-20,"Amazing taste and texture is just the one in premium brands like Gaspri and Muslepharm. Mixability is also very good. But taste is the best. Also for the people saying that there is a hole in the seal, I confirmed from GNC, it is not and has been done by the company. It's their new method of packing the product in which the hole is having very fine filter so that nothing goes in or out of the container except air and air pressure is equalised on both sides (for those who can understand). Total value for money product.",

Arijit,Nice buy,4,23-Jan-19,"Decent taste. Certainly original as I have verified it through their sms service. Only downside is mixing is really tough. I use a mixer and it still doesn't mix properly! Also doesn't mix well in hot milk. Never tried mixing using a shaker though. Also, I did a lot of calculations. This supplement offers one of the best protein/rupee ratio, much better than muscleblaze gold or massgainer pro and the likes. Of course, there is a limit to serving size so you can get only 12 g of protein at once. What I'm trying to say here is that it's cost-effective and bang for your buck",
Umang,MB is nice but Bad shipping,5,16-Oct-18,Get this üí∞ 999Seems to be nice. As I heard about MB it is a genuine product that's why I buy this.Can give the review after use.But jar was broken when I get this.Amazing part is amazon refund it. Due to broken jar. Thanks,
Arun Vashist,Good protein for regular use and gym beginners,4,3-Jan-19,"For beginners it's a great option to start with, it has around 12% protein, digestive enzymes for easy absorption of protein and no sugar.Taste is a personal choice but I have found the chocolate flavour really tasty.Mixing it with water and milk is not really effortless, but not that bad.",
Prashant_PJ,Very Effective And Genuine Product.,5,22-May-18,Muscle blaze has always been a trusted brand for fitness  So I decided to order this Supplement..But I was doubt that I would get the original product or not..When the product was received it was completely original.. A code is given inside its lid. That code can be detected by messaging.,
Amazon Customer,Cheaters,1,28-Jan-19,"The quantity of the powder I wonder if it‚Äôs even 750mg , forget about 1 kg , as you can see the picture the box is more than half empty as I open it. No wonder it was so cheap , I don‚Äôt know if this product is even genuine. Why cheat us ? When you can‚Äôt deliver quality products.",
ST,Low quality protein,2,4-May-19,The protein content is too low and this product causes bloating. The base of the container looked as though someone tried to cut it open and empty the content,
Parichay,It's a SCAM,1,19-Jan-19,1. In one serving you get only 12 g protein which is disgusting and 12 g of carbohydrates which should not be there in whey protein.2. Bottom seal is broken in most of the packs and item isn't returnable too. That's sad3. At same price go for some protein which has 20-24 g of protein per scoop and low carbohydratesVERY BAD DEAL IN ALL,
Bharat Singh,A brief Review of Beginner Protein.,3,17-Jan-19,"Product is good. However, those having indigestion issues shouldn't buy this. As, it contains artificial sweeteners as well as high quantity of Carbohydrates which don't digest quickly will leave you in lurch and will cause flatuation and bloating all around the day. I would recommend go for high protein content with no artificial sweeteners and low carbs. Any product of muscleblaze shows result with consistent hard work accompanied with good diet and rest(min 6-7 hours a day).I also recommend you to drink water as much as possible at least 4 litres a day while on protein intake. Drink protein powder in water not in milk. Milk contains caesin protein which is useful at night before bed. If Caesin mix whey protein l, it will take a lot of time to digest and again bloating and flatualence.Best time of protein shake- Anabolic State and/or Between the meals.All the best friends!",
srikara,Great for beginners,5,14-Oct-18,"I used this product for a month, this was my first protein supplement, before buying this I was really nervous but now I've seen significant amount of muscle gain and u can see muscle growth in 2 weeks for use real confidence booster for beginner great product by muscle blaze hope beginners will find this helpfulüòâüòâüòÑ",
Nitin,Make a proper Research before buying this,3,23-Mar-21,"Hi All, I am writing this review after using 1 box of this beginner's protein. certainly it will help you with your supplement requirements. BUT you need to research a little not for this product but yourself. just check your skin, if it is acne prone, don't buy it. It causes severe acne breakout. soon after taking this protein, I faced acne breakout on my face and back and on places where i never saw a pimple before. You can study online about this and choose a right brand and not this just because a shaker is free with it. thats what I did. I moved on to Myprotein. Although it is a bit expensive than this but I moved on from this product. I will write a review regarding my protein also after using it for a significant time.",
Yogesh,Not Genuine,1,5-Feb-19,"The geniun check failed..Got below SMS ""product name or code was not recognized. Please check the code for any typing errors. If any issues, please contact MuscleBlaze customer care at +918527732632.""",

Aditya Saurav,Good purchase!,4,11-Jul-20,"Well I started working out few months ago and it was a helluva journey. A cousin of mine who's a fitness freak üòÇ recommended me this. I got it fairly quick even in lockdown thanks to Amazon delivery service. I'd say it fulfilled its purpose. Since its a beginner product, it'll give you 12g of protein in one heaping scoop which is fairly enough for a beginner. It'll never miraculously help you in shedding weight as the product never intended to, its main purpose is to provide you protein which can be easily aborbed by your body after your workout session so that your muscles can heal up. Long story short its a good product to kickstart your healthly lifestyle. I've used it and I'm happy with it.",
Dhruv tiwari,This is real or fake product..,4,8-Oct-18,What is this to the back side of jar..is this fake item?,
ShEkhR_ShROff,Good,5,2-Nov-20,This whey protein is good and flavor is amazing. So tasty i will use 25g/day (15x2) morning 7:20 and evening 19:00You can buy this product,
Amazon Customer,Dont buy,1,24-Nov-18,Extremely poor quality and half filled box.Complete waste of money,
Ajith,Problem with shaker,4,13-Oct-20,"The product is good but the shaker is not air tight and while shaking with liquid (milk or water) inside some drops comes out of the edges of the side cap and the top sipper is air tight, no problem with the sipper part. Please modify the cap as airtight. btw the quality of plastic used in the shaker is awesome though. Thanks.",
MOSES MARK RAI,Good,4,29-Sep-19,So why is this protein very cheap as compared to other protein powders here is your answer yes the protein is cheap as it has lesser amount of protein % per scoop which is about 12g and plus 12g for carbohydrates as well comes with it other when protein has higher prices as they come with whipping amount of 26-30g of protein with 3.1g of carbohydrates...Now should we buy it is it worth it yes it is two scoops can give you 24g of protein and 24g of carbohydrates now now before you think isnt carbohydrates also there yes ut is but you can later reduce the carbohydrate intake from your diet to balance the calories.Now for the mixing it mixes well but only one scoop in 200ml water it doesn't have that heavy texture but 2 scoop will give you the perfect texturePricing yes 998 33servings it's a good dealLastly you cant label a protein powder good or bad just because you used it once at least 5-6 months you gotta use it in order to see the difference . And Getting a Good physique just doesnt come by consuming heavy expensive whey protein it takes time heavy lifting balanced diet and along with protein powder combination of all these can lead you to your fitness goal .I hope my review helps you in your fitness journey good luck,
Mahesh,not sure its genuine or not,1,16-Jan-19,i dont know its original product or not but its not good for health i become sick after taking it,
Salami,Useless pouch,1,28-Jan-22,"They've changed giving it from the box to the pouch, first every time its cumbersome to open and close the zip lock of this pouch.  And the second worst thing is the whole powder comes up flying in air once you open them due to pressure release as this is dry powder.  I don't understand how come a company could ruin a product for a customer just by spoiling the convenience of using it. Very disappointed and pathetic.",
Bisheswar Karmakar,Packs a punch,5,15-Jun-22,"This is the absolute best product you can find in this category. Perfect for muscle growth and keeping carbs and fat to a bare minimum. The protein content is almost double compared to other products, and what matters even more is the carb content which is extremely low.I'd say a 8/10 product, 2 points off for its poor solubility in both water and milk. Forms clumps and then I'd have to chomp on it separately.",
Shahjad Khan,Good one for beginners,3,22-Aug-19,Not a nice product overallBut it‚Äôs a suitable product for the beginners.,
Dhiraj Karne,Flavor is good and best for beginners who don't know what is protein and why take it so go for it,4,6-Jan-21,"First think this is not Muscle builder,fat loss product, weight gainer. This is only protein and this protein is good for beginners. Let's talk about flavor flavour is pawder chocolate i tried it with water and also milk in water i don't like it but when I try with milk this iss too good like chocolate milk shake i drink it daily. This protein 1 kg upto 50 to 60 days I takr 1 scoop daily with milk. I forgot about shaker so shakers material quality is good in shaker mixer the protein properly mix with milk or water",
Dillen,"Good, but not good:)",3,28-Dec-19,"It is all good, but better start consuming whey protein from start itself. If you read the protein content of this product, it us just 12 gms per serving, which quite less. Instead of this better go for Whey protein performance or Whey protein energy. And always go for flavour ones, because the unflavored ones are not easy to consume, you'll feel like you're on medication. So go for a product that is high in protein content, and which is flavoured. Thanks!",
DDas,I liked d product,4,13-Nov-18,Good product and received well packed from Amazon. I liked d product helps to boost strength spclly when u r tired from heavy workout. Tastes very good chocolatey. Thick and rich taste in milk or warm water. I consume once a day only after work out..so 5 days a week. It's my 1st experience with protein powder.,
Prakash Pathak,Don't buy received only half kg product tampered from bottom.,1,12-Sep-20,"Received tampered product , looks like someone has taken almost 300-400 grams of powder from bottom.I checked the code it was authentic product from muscle blaze but the jar was tempered from bottom. When I open the jar it was only half fill. I thought that would be the quantity as I was buying for the first time but yesterday when I refill the jar with asitis whey I realised that someone has taken around 30-400 grams out and repack the jar from bottom.Even it was purchased from the reputed seller it's a altered.Amazon should look into these kind of issue. 1st time users can be cheated easily by sellers.",
Mohammed Haisham Harees,Absolutely recommend it,4,24-Aug-21,"At first, I was a bit skeptical about buying this protein powder because of a lot claims from people who have used it here in the review section. I saw people complaining about how they developed certain skin problems and allergies. But I decided to buy it anyways and try it for myself and I am glad that I did.I gained close to 4kg last time I checked my weight. I am seeing a noticeable difference in my muscle growth. And no, I didn't experience any sort of side effects or whatever. But you have to know that, protein powder can cause certain side effects to some people (I have read MB's blog). But the only way to know it is by trying it for yourself.The flavour is rich and it tastes sort of creamy. Gonna order another bottles soon. Totally recommended. üòä",
Madhavendra Singh,Received damaged container,1,25 April 2021,"The seal was broken and had a hole in it and the taste was unusual prolly spoiled or contaminated had to throw it away. It was my first time buying supplements online and even when many people asked me to not buy it online even my fitness trainer even then I did, but Thanks to Amazon I received a full refund but it was still a disappointment to receive damage product after waiting for 5 days after placing the orderSo I'd recommend buy these things offline if you want to maintain a strict workout regime without any disturbance in day to day schedule a few hundred bucks are still worth to spend if you want your body to stay fit.But I've used this product earlier for like a year now so I'd say it's good for beginners just maintain a strict diet and buy it offline to reduce unwanted stress Amazon isn't a good choice for buying consumable or edible goods I'm saying this from past experiences too.",

VIVEK KHULLAR,Quality issues worst product received from Amazon,1,9-Feb-21,Received a defect quality product from Amazon. Its stinking and unconsumed one. I have informed both amazon and muscle blaze about it. And the irony is that no one is showing zeal to take the  responsibility of there fault product. Poor service shown by amazon to its prime and certified buyer.,
Manish,"Contains Maltodextrin, Protein content is very less per scoop",3,22-Nov-20,"Pros1. The flavor is good.2. The packaging is good.3. Mixability is good.4. It is okay for a price of Rs. 999.5. Funnily, it is enough sweet that you can use it as a substitute for adding sugar (if you have a habit of eating sugary food) because of its ingredients.Cons1. It contains Maltodextrin which has a very high GI, google and you would understand more, it is not a recommended ingredient if you have diabetes.2. The protein quantity per scoop is very less, so it might not be recommended if you have a little more experience or even for fast muscle recovery.3. Not recommended if you need insulin spike in your body.4. Not recommended for intermediate gym people.My verdict - It was good for a start but I am not gonna buy it again.If you really want Muscleblaze protein, go with MB Fuel one+.For students like me- If it is cheap, it doesn't mean it will be as effective, add 200 more and you can get unflavoured whey protein of MB which has higher protein content.",
Preeti,Go for beginners,4,20-Jun-20,It's an excellent product to start with protein supplement...the flavour makes it palatable.if you wish to fullfill your daily basic protein requirement apart from food you consume...go for it and you will see the results.i was suffering from excessive hairloss..one of the basic reason is lack of enough protein... although I was having eggs regularly...the day I started consuming it..my hairfall has reduced to 60%.unlike other heavy duty protein supplement this will not harm your body if you skip your workout for the day,
Vikram reddy,Show powder,1,12-Oct-21,"Disgusting powder ever had, got it and had 1 day in morning after workout ofcourse i had preworkout meal sprouts, evening something i felt wrong in my stomach, started to feel like heavy air is occupied in intestine and unable to get out. That feel was there for whole night. I will never use this brand in life, and i make sure no one in my friends circle will buy this product.",
Akshay S.,Ideal for Beginners,4,22-Feb-21,"Beginners WheyPros1. Price : You can‚Äôt complain on this, don‚Äôt even try.2. Solubility is good, decent I‚Äôd say. Mix it with water/milk and grind for a smooth shake.3. Storage : Comes in an airtight jar4. Validity : You could easily check through the code given over the lid.5. Would easily last a month for 1 heap full scoop per day, depending on the usage.6. Taste : Everyone relates to this word ‚ÄúChocolate‚Äù. Not bad at all.7. Certainly the best option out there for beginners and those seeking a budget friendly deal.8. Ideal Protein Content : Around 12 gms of protein is the safest bait for any beginner. Not more, no less.Cons1. Could cause digestion problems to lactose intolerant individuals and those with any history of stomach issues.2. If you‚Äôre not working out regularly, bloating is a possibility.3. A bit on the sweeter side. I like sweet, you may not though. Try adding more water or milk as per your taste.Note : Add water first and then the powder for ideal mixing and to avoid lumps.",

Vikas,Best product for beginners,5,1-May-19,"It is the best product for beginners who want to take protein.Can be taken with both water and milk,but to cut calories better use with water. It tastes better like cholate milkshake with milk though.I would recommend to use milk at night and avoid with milk at daytime who have digestion problem. 12g protein/scoop which is good.You can feel the result yourself.It wont help much for gains but it will for fat loss if you do appropriate exercise.Mixes very well,no foam or clumps are formed.Must buy product.",
Vaishnavi,It works for me,4,14-Aug-22,Have used it for a month now and health wise there are no side effects for me.It has good taste and if made exactly as directed it has a consistency of a milk shake.It has also helped me with my muscle recovery.Very happy with the product,

It says 12g per serving. If you calculate 30g of the substance for one serving then 12/30 is only 40 percentage whey. There are other products that exactly specify this, for a good one is around 84% or 84g per 100g. There are similar priced ones that has upto 80%. This means that the other 40 percent consists of maltodextrin which is like a filler substance that does not have any nutritional value. Do not buy.",

I like it more with milk though.I have been having 1 scoop a day with 250ml of milk pre work out of 15 mins and I lost 2 kgs in 11 days! It does not have a bad after taste. Its also great for all those times when I feel too hungry and weak to get out of bed because of my thyroid problem.Just one gulp fills me with energy to happily start my day! I simply cannot live without it. It has changed my life!,

Santosh Kumar,"Bang for the buck, authentic product and lovely taste!",4,27-Mar-19,"I am totally in love with this Whey Protein powder from Muscle Blaze; the taste is so yummy and similar to a high quality chocloate milkshake. I believe this is an authentic Muscle Blaze product and all the people posting reviews  questioning the authenticity and pointing at the molding mark on the bottom of the box really ought to stop being so ignorant and read the product description on the images. Coming to the nutritional value, the protein content is pretty good for a beginner like myself although I feel the Carbs are slightly on the higher side but this is definitely still the best sugar free Whey protein product currently.",
Anima,Good protein powder,5,8-Jul-22,This is my first time using a whey protein powder. It has a good taste. I bought chocolate flavour but is a little sweet. Scoop is also included in the pack.It is an authentic product. You can scan the QR code mentioned on the pack.,
Pradeep,"Low quality, not soluble",3,20-Jan-19,"It's one of the cheaper whey brands in market, but thats for a reason. Per gram of protein its as costly as other brands. Few issues in the product:1: Low solubility - shaker alone wont be sufficient, you'll have to use a mixer2: Low protein content - 50% of weight is in carbs, so double the price and that reflects true cost of product3'; taste - very sweet for my liking, has to do with 50% carbselse, product was authenticated, packaging was done well and delivered on time.",

Ravi S.,Protien is less carbohydrate is more.,1,24-Jun-22,For 30 gram it provides only 12GM of protien and 13.2 GM of carbohydrates. So it will not helpful to get lean muscle. Instead of shredding money on this better take 2eggs will get 12GM of protien ofBiginners take eggs rather than this.,
Deepak Chawla,Unable to get rid of lumps,2,12-Jan-21,"The taste seems to be different as compared to others. The major issue is that it is very difficult to get rid of Lumps once you mix the powder im water. I have used Himalaya Quista Pro, yeah price is more but quality is far better than this.",

Amazon Customer,Don't buy this product because it is totally fake.,1,9-Mar-19,This is a fake product.Please don't buy it. After using this protein i have body rashesh problems.,481
Ayush,I bought it for my daily protein requirement,5,5-Dec-21,"Well I am not into hardcore gymming stuff, I bought this to full fill my daily protein requirement  as everyone knows how's the hostels/pg have food quality.This time I tried protine powder from the muscle blaze before this I used to consume protinex which was much more costing than this, so bought cookie and cream flavour and I was surprised that it actually tasted like cookie and cream.I consume this with milk not with water as you know I am not into muscle building just some cardio stuff, so I don't need that instant protine intake.Can't comment on the sugar thing, as it has been mentioned on the nutritional value stricker that zero sugar but it always tasted sweet. May that flavour thing made it taste sweet.Overall it's a nice product, you guys can give it a try.After this, I am gonna try one of among mango or chocolate.",499
Sun,Just use it !!! Better than before üç∂ü•õ,5,1-Jul-21,"Extremely tasty and high quality Muscle Blaze  Beginners whey protein . I have been using Muscle Blaze for 2 years , but this one tastes so much better. Please buy,  everyone. Not only fitness enthusiasts, other adults in your family will love it like they do regular drinks in the market .",423
praveen,Good taste,5,10-Jun-21,"Build quality of the shaker is nice and even though gives a wierd flavour at the beginning, overall a pleasant taste when taken with some chilled water or ice.Yet a beginner so no idea about the nutritional improvement due to this",422
Suman Suresh,Genuineness 100 percent,5,24 April 2021,"I brought this product trusting the genuineness of the brand. I read a lot of reviews claiming the protein content was low, it was specifically written that this supplement was for beginners. Muscleblaze has other supplements having higher protein content too. The delivery, product and service was exemplary and followed to the word specified. Highly recommended for beginners",422
Lokesh Surana,Perfect product for beginners,5,29-Nov-20,"Read the description in the product. Initial you use half the scoop for first five days, then one scoop per day and slowly increasing it to two scoop per day.They also have codes to identify whether your product is authentic or not.",421
Tamal Roy,Value for money,4,10-Jun-20,"Perfect for beginners, you can have this with milk or water, while doing your workout. This is perfectly value for money, and really gives you energy while working out. Flavour is really good, and the packaging is awesome. You also get a spoon with the big container which keeps the whey safe.You should remember that this is whey protein, so don't have this before workout.One spoon a day is enough, and at the beginning, half spoon is enough.In short, it is highly recommended for beginners. The protein quantity is 40% which is Perfect for beginners, but if you are a pro, go for whey raw protein of the same company MuscleBlaze",473
Pritam,Totally satisfying Supplement,5,21-Sep-18,"If you want to get some good muscle mass. Then try this. Super delicious. If you have never tried whey protein they try this beginner's protein because this contains protein as much as carbohydrates! Which will give you optimum performances! No side effects. (Unless you have problens with lactic products)!DON'T GO FOR OTHER WHEY PROTEIN WHICH HAS 24G+ OF PROTEIN IN 32G OF SERVING IF YOU ARE TRYING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME, BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DIGEST THOSE IN FIRST TRY. SO BETTER TRY THIS FIRST",242
Rahul R.,Fake Product...,1,11-Oct-18,"No even One Star...Very dissapointed with Amazon...Fake product I got stomach ache , loose motion and swealing in limps and cheeks after having this product..Their side effect started after 3 weeks...My condition is bad now..I refer to doctor. He told me to stop taking this product.If I continue.. My condition will become more worse...So All who want to purchase these Product.I will suggest you to take different product not this product..Thank Youüôèüòîüòî",229
Arijit,Nice buy,4,23-Jan-19,"Decent taste. Certainly original as I have verified it through their sms service. Only downside is mixing is really tough. I use a mixer and it still doesn't mix properly! Also doesn't mix well in hot milk. Never tried mixing using a shaker though. Also, I did a lot of calculations. This supplement offers one of the best protein/rupee ratio, much better than muscleblaze gold or massgainer pro and the likes. Of course, there is a limit to serving size so you can get only 12 g of protein at once. What I'm trying to say here is that it's cost-effective and bang for your buck",483
Umang,MB is nice but Bad shipping,5,16-Oct-18,Get this üí∞ 999Seems to be nice. As I heard about MB it is a genuine product that's why I buy this.Can give the review after use.But jar was broken when I get this.Amazing part is amazon refund it. Due to broken jar. Thanks,245
Arun Vashist,Good protein for regular use and gym beginners,4,3-Jan-19,"For beginners it's a great option to start with, it has around 12% protein, digestive enzymes for easy absorption of protein and no sugar.Taste is a personal choice but I have found the chocolate flavour really tasty.Mixing it with water and milk is not really effortless, but not that bad.",473
Prashant_PJ,Very Effective And Genuine Product.,5,22-May-18,Muscle blaze has always been a trusted brand for fitness  So I decided to order this Supplement..But I was doubt that I would get the original product or not..When the product was received it was completely original.. A code is given inside its lid. That code can be detected by messaging.,476
Amazon Customer,Cheaters,1,28-Jan-19,"The quantity of the powder I wonder if it‚Äôs even 750mg , forget about 1 kg , as you can see the picture the box is more than half empty as I open it. No wonder it was so cheap , I don‚Äôt know if this product is even genuine. Why cheat us ? When you can‚Äôt deliver quality products.",91
ST,Low quality protein,2,4-May-19,The protein content is too low and this product causes bloating. The base of the container looked as though someone tried to cut it open and empty the content,81
Parichay,It's a SCAM,1,19-Jan-19,1. In one serving you get only 12 g protein which is disgusting and 12 g of carbohydrates which should not be there in whey protein.2. Bottom seal is broken in most of the packs and item isn't returnable too. That's sad3. At same price go for some protein which has 20-24 g of protein per scoop and low carbohydratesVERY BAD DEAL IN ALL,55
Bharat Singh,A brief Review of Beginner Protein.,3,17-Jan-19,"Product is good. However, those having indigestion issues shouldn't buy this. As, it contains artificial sweeteners as well as high quantity of Carbohydrates which don't digest quickly will leave you in lurch and will cause flatuation and bloating all around the day. I would recommend go for high protein content with no artificial sweeteners and low carbs. Any product of muscleblaze shows result with consistent hard work accompanied with good diet and rest(min 6-7 hours a day).I also recommend you to drink water as much as possible at least 4 litres a day while on protein intake. Drink protein powder in water not in milk. Milk contains caesin protein which is useful at night before bed. If Caesin mix whey protein l, it will take a lot of time to digest and again bloating and flatualence.Best time of protein shake- Anabolic State and/or Between the meals.All the best friends!",47
srikara,Great for beginners,5,14-Oct-18,"I used this product for a month, this was my first protein supplement, before buying this I was really nervous but now I've seen significant amount of muscle gain and u can see muscle growth in 2 weeks for use real confidence booster for beginner great product by muscle blaze hope beginners will find this helpfulüòâüòâüòÑ",104
Nitin,Make a proper Research before buying this,3,23-Mar-21,"Hi All, I am writing this review after using 1 box of this beginner's protein. certainly it will help you with your supplement requirements. BUT you need to research a little not for this product but yourself. just check your skin, if it is acne prone, don't buy it. It causes severe acne breakout. soon after taking this protein, I faced acne breakout on my face and back and on places where i never saw a pimple before. You can study online about this and choose a right brand and not this just because a shaker is free with it. thats what I did. I moved on to Myprotein. Although it is a bit expensive than this but I moved on from this product. I will write a review regarding my protein also after using it for a significant time.",22
Salami,Useless pouch,1,28-Jan-22,"They've changed giving it from the box to the pouch, first every time its cumbersome to open and close the zip lock of this pouch.  And the second worst thing is the whole powder comes up flying in air once you open them due to pressure release as this is dry powder.  I don't understand how come a company could ruin a product for a customer just by spoiling the convenience of using it. Very disappointed and pathetic.",2
Bisheswar Karmakar,Packs a punch,5,15-Jun-22,"This is the absolute best product you can find in this category. Perfect for muscle growth and keeping carbs and fat to a bare minimum. The protein content is almost double compared to other products, and what matters even more is the carb content which is extremely low.I'd say a 8/10 product, 2 points off for its poor solubility in both water and milk. Forms clumps and then I'd have to chomp on it separately.",1
Shahjad Khan,Good one for beginners,3,22-Aug-19,Not a nice product overallBut it‚Äôs a suitable product for the beginners.,11
Dhiraj Karne,Flavor is good and best for beginners who don't know what is protein and why take it so go for it,4,6-Jan-21,"First think this is not Muscle builder,fat loss product, weight gainer. This is only protein and this protein is good for beginners. Let's talk about flavor flavour is pawder chocolate i tried it with water and also milk in water i don't like it but when I try with milk this iss too good like chocolate milk shake i drink it daily. This protein 1 kg upto 50 to 60 days I takr 1 scoop daily with milk. I forgot about shaker so shakers material quality is good in shaker mixer the protein properly mix with milk or water",2
Dillen,"Good, but not good:)",3,28-Dec-19,"It is all good, but better start consuming whey protein from start itself. If you read the protein content of this product, it us just 12 gms per serving, which quite less. Instead of this better go for Whey protein performance or Whey protein energy. And always go for flavour ones, because the unflavored ones are not easy to consume, you'll feel like you're on medication. So go for a product that is high in protein content, and which is flavoured. Thanks!",6
DDas,I liked d product,4,13-Nov-18,Good product and received well packed from Amazon. I liked d product helps to boost strength spclly when u r tired from heavy workout. Tastes very good chocolatey. Thick and rich taste in milk or warm water. I consume once a day only after work out..so 5 days a week. It's my 1st experience with protein powder.,8
Prakash Pathak,Don't buy received only half kg product tampered from bottom.,1,12-Sep-20,"Received tampered product , looks like someone has taken almost 300-400 grams of powder from bottom.I checked the code it was authentic product from muscle blaze but the jar was tempered from bottom. When I open the jar it was only half fill. I thought that would be the quantity as I was buying for the first time but yesterday when I refill the jar with asitis whey I realised that someone has taken around 30-400 grams out and repack the jar from bottom.Even it was purchased from the reputed seller it's a altered.Amazon should look into these kind of issue. 1st time users can be cheated easily by sellers.",3
Mohammed Haisham Harees,Absolutely recommend it,4,24-Aug-21,"At first, I was a bit skeptical about buying this protein powder because of a lot claims from people who have used it here in the review section. I saw people complaining about how they developed certain skin problems and allergies. But I decided to buy it anyways and try it for myself and I am glad that I did.I gained close to 4kg last time I checked my weight. I am seeing a noticeable difference in my muscle growth. And no, I didn't experience any sort of side effects or whatever. But you have to know that, protein powder can cause certain side effects to some people (I have read MB's blog). But the only way to know it is by trying it for yourself.The flavour is rich and it tastes sort of creamy. Gonna order another bottles soon. Totally recommended. üòä",2
Madhavendra Singh,Received damaged container,1,25 April 2021,"The seal was broken and had a hole in it and the taste was unusual prolly spoiled or contaminated had to throw it away. It was my first time buying supplements online and even when many people asked me to not buy it online even my fitness trainer even then I did, but Thanks to Amazon I received a full refund but it was still a disappointment to receive damage product after waiting for 5 days after placing the orderSo I'd recommend buy these things offline if you want to maintain a strict workout regime without any disturbance in day to day schedule a few hundred bucks are still worth to spend if you want your body to stay fit.But I've used this product earlier for like a year now so I'd say it's good for beginners just maintain a strict diet and buy it offline to reduce unwanted stress Amazon isn't a good choice for buying consumable or edible goods I'm saying this from past experiences too.",1
Ashok,Disappointed.,1,3-Mar-19,I got these product and I checked it was authentic but it was becoming soapy when I diluted it..I don't know what the hell I got .Although delivery was fastüòÇüòÇ,10
VIVEK KHULLAR,Quality issues worst product received from Amazon,1,9-Feb-21,Received a defect quality product from Amazon. Its stinking and unconsumed one. I have informed both amazon and muscle blaze about it. And the irony is that no one is showing zeal to take the  responsibility of there fault product. Poor service shown by amazon to its prime and certified buyer.,4
Manish,"Contains Maltodextrin, Protein content is very less per scoop",3,22-Nov-20,"Pros1. The flavor is good.2. The packaging is good.3. Mixability is good.4. It is okay for a price of Rs. 999.5. Funnily, it is enough sweet that you can use it as a substitute for adding sugar (if you have a habit of eating sugary food) because of its ingredients.Cons1. It contains Maltodextrin which has a very high GI, google and you would understand more, it is not a recommended ingredient if you have diabetes.2. The protein quantity per scoop is very less, so it might not be recommended if you have a little more experience or even for fast muscle recovery.3. Not recommended if you need insulin spike in your body.4. Not recommended for intermediate gym people.My verdict - It was good for a start but I am not gonna buy it again.If you really want Muscleblaze protein, go with MB Fuel one+.For students like me- If it is cheap, it doesn't mean it will be as effective, add 200 more and you can get unflavoured whey protein of MB which has higher protein content.",2
Preeti,Go for beginners,4,20-Jun-20,It's an excellent product to start with protein supplement...the flavour makes it palatable.if you wish to fullfill your daily basic protein requirement apart from food you consume...go for it and you will see the results.i was suffering from excessive hairloss..one of the basic reason is lack of enough protein... although I was having eggs regularly...the day I started consuming it..my hairfall has reduced to 60%.unlike other heavy duty protein supplement this will not harm your body if you skip your workout for the day,3
Vikram reddy,Show powder,1,12-Oct-21,"Disgusting powder ever had, got it and had 1 day in morning after workout ofcourse i had preworkout meal sprouts, evening something i felt wrong in my stomach, started to feel like heavy air is occupied in intestine and unable to get out. That feel was there for whole night. I will never use this brand in life, and i make sure no one in my friends circle will buy this product.",2
Akshay S.,Ideal for Beginners,4,22-Feb-21,"Beginners WheyPros1. Price : You can‚Äôt complain on this, don‚Äôt even try.2. Solubility is good, decent I‚Äôd say. Mix it with water/milk and grind for a smooth shake.3. Storage : Comes in an airtight jar4. Validity : You could easily check through the code given over the lid.5. Would easily last a month for 1 heap full scoop per day, depending on the usage.6. Taste : Everyone relates to this word ‚ÄúChocolate‚Äù. Not bad at all.7. Certainly the best option out there for beginners and those seeking a budget friendly deal.8. Ideal Protein Content : Around 12 gms of protein is the safest bait for any beginner. Not more, no less.Cons1. Could cause digestion problems to lactose intolerant individuals and those with any history of stomach issues.2. If you‚Äôre not working out regularly, bloating is a possibility.3. A bit on the sweeter side. I like sweet, you may not though. Try adding more water or milk as per your taste.Note : Add water first and then the powder for ideal mixing and to avoid lumps.",2
DIPIN C,Beware of pinworms in stomach,1,21-Sep-19,"It contain 1:1 ratio of protein and carbohydratesProtein powder will be 3/4 of the container but weighing 1kg.Whenever I drunk this , i had a pin worm issues and need to consult a doctor to solve the problem",6
Vikas,Best product for beginners,5,1-May-19,"It is the best product for beginners who want to take protein.Can be taken with both water and milk,but to cut calories better use with water. It tastes better like cholate milkshake with milk though.I would recommend to use milk at night and avoid with milk at daytime who have digestion problem. 12g protein/scoop which is good.You can feel the result yourself.It wont help much for gains but it will for fat loss if you do appropriate exercise.Mixes very well,no foam or clumps are formed.Must buy product.",3
Vaishnavi,It works for me,4,14-Aug-22,Have used it for a month now and health wise there are no side effects for me.It has good taste and if made exactly as directed it has a consistency of a milk shake.It has also helped me with my muscle recovery.Very happy with the product,1

It says 12g per serving. If you calculate 30g of the substance for one serving then 12/30 is only 40 percentage whey. There are other products that exactly specify this, for a good one is around 84% or 84g per 100g. There are similar priced ones that has upto 80%. This means that the other 40 percent consists of maltodextrin which is like a filler substance that does not have any nutritional value. Do not buy.",3

Ron Baruah,Great entry level protein suppliment,4,22-Jul-18,"This product was my entry into the world of protein supplements and by far it has exceeded my expectations. This is made of whey concentrate which compared to the other forms like whey isolate has 80% protein only, but bear in mind unless you are a gym freak 80% protein is sufficient for you as this won't be the only meal you'll have all day. It has a mild sweet taste, which I personally prefer more than a strong sweetness. And if you are wondering about the taste, the chocolate flavour is pretty decent too and you can easily convince yourself it is a chocolate milkshake. It has the essential amino acids and BCAA with nothing that can be harmful for you. Although it is optimized for use with milk I recommend using it with water as whey is already a part of milk and adding milk makes it a thick and a bit slimy, also you can keep the nutritional value from the liquid part of the shake zero with water.The major down point being the amount of carbohydrates in it. Ideally in order to lose weight and make lean muscles carbohydrates should be avoided, unfortunately this should be termed a carb shake with 12 grams of protein but 12.5 grams of carbs per 30g serving.Inside the packet there is a verification code to see if the product is genuine and also a 30g scoop within the powder.On a budget, this is a decent product but not a value for money.",4
Afroz mujawar,excellent product.,5,31-Mar-18,excellent product...the fluctuations in the body can be notified after 8-10 days with proper exercise..muscle starts to gain and it also increases weight....the best time to take this is at night which will help to recover the muscles,10

Shraboni Sinha,Very good quality protein.,5,7-Sep-20,"Whey protein is commonly used for improving athletic performance and increasing strength, but evidence to support these uses is mixed. Whey protein is also used to reverse weight loss in people with HIV and to help prevent allergic conditions in infants. Whey protein is a source of protein that might improve the nutrient content of the diet. Whey protein might also have effects on the immune system.This is a very high-quality Beginners WHEY protein. Beginners whey protein means it does not have a high amount of protein, which really good for beginners. Actually, protein consumption depends on your body habit, so if you are not habituated then there may be a problem occur to digest the whey protein. I joined the gym two months ago. That's why I brought this protein. It helps me to maintain the protein balance of my body. I just love its double chocolate flavor.--This Whey Protein is Gluten Free.--This Whey Protein Banned Substance Free.--There is a 33gm Scoop inside the container also.--It is fast-acting whey protein. Imported from the USA.--It is ultra-filtered Whey for less cholesterol, fat & sodium.--It contains Digestive Enzymes for faster absorption.--It can be mix easily using glass and spoon.--It is manufactured in an ISO certified company.--It provides 12gm Protein, 12.5gm carbohydrate, 0.95gm Fat, and 104KCAL in per scoop serving.It has 90% Isolated Whey Protein, Cocoa bean extract, Sodium Chloride, Xanthum gum (INS 415).  The presence of these ingredients is really a good sign of a good quality protein powder. It provides energy and enhanced body performance. It helps to recover fastly from tiredness also.It also has Digestive Enzymes like- Lactase, Papain & Bromelain. These Digestive Enzymes help to digest this protein very fast.This whey protein is instantized. That means if there is no shaker cup or any blender, just add one rounded scoop of this Whey protein to a glass filled with 6-7oz (200 ml approx) of water, low-fat milk, or any favorite beverage. Then mix it up with a spoon, stir it until the powder is completely dissolved.This Whey Protein can be used for more than just protein shakes. By adding fresh or frozen fruits, peanut butter, flaxseed oil, coconut, and other high-energy ingredients, can transform the shake into a delicious high-protein meal.It also can be consumed by mixing a scoop of it with oatmeal, yogurt.Take 1-2 servings a day or as suggested by the dietician. I take this Whey protein twice a day. I take it with water at the time of breakfast and in the evening after the Gym.--Please use this before 18months of manufacture.--Net Weight is 1KG.",2

Aditya Bhushan,Found INSECT and PLASTIC material inside the protein Jar,1,3-Sep-21,[ Buyers Read this review carefully ]When I purchased this I never thought such a disgusting incident can happen to me.After few weeks of usage when I serving my scoop I suddenly look into my jar and I saw something black and light brown substance.when I investigate it. It was a insect and a plastic material you can see all the pics I already attached.This is pathetic and very injurious to our health.Then I call firstly Muscleblaze ( they are just taking advantage on the tag of being Indian brand ).Call not connected. Then I email my issue and call again next day.MB customer consultant disconnect my call they are saying this is my fault ( Saying why this happened after long time ).( Where you kept the protein jar )( Why this happened in the bottom of jar if there is insect it comes just after opening )and some more silly replyTrust me they are not even apologize for their mistake.I am really disappointed from this.I will never gonna use MUSCLEBLAZE product I swear.I hope all the buyers think many times before using this cheap brand.,1
Rakesh Swain,First drink first impressions,5,9-Sep-21,Update : After a 1.5 months of usage. Loving it. Does the job. Ordering it again. Though it has increased the price by 100 bucks. Inflation everywhere!______________________________________________Checked my orders. Had ordered ‚ÄãWhey Energy Choclate for the last 10 times. So thought for a change of flavor and some extra protein.Pros:1.  Mango flavour is not as good as the choclate I was used to but good enough when mixed with milk. May be I need to give it time.2. The biggest pro over whey energy choclate is the absorbency. Mixes so well with chilled milk with same amount of shaking. Didn't find a single lump.3. Extra protein per scoop. I drink half before and half after workout. Good energy during workout and good recovery post workout.4. Unique scoop mechanism.5. No bloating or indigestion of any sort even though some extra protein. I mix 1 scoop with 500ml of chilled milk.Cons :1. Nothing as of now except may be a bit pricey I guess.,151
Misbah,Best ever protien,5,5-Aug-21,I have used this protien since 10 days and I can say that it's good protien it's taste is awesome also it digests quickly I have used almost all imported brands but this one is nest level better than asitis better than bigmuscle better than imported brands go for it but price is little bit costly on whey protien and biozyme whey isolate is very costly than imported brands I will recommend U only Biozyme performance whey coz it's in budget range but if u want to buy biozyme whey protien and biozyme whey isolate then please don't buy these two because imported brand price and these two price are almost same go only for biozyme performance whey,125

¬†I tried lots of variety in whey protein,but this protein is a one step upper then all other indian brand.I have been using MB Whey for a long time.And The result is great and if u use this whey or any MB product ,then u feel the rusult in one week.. and the best part of MuscleBlaze all information are clearly mention in product packaging..and one more best thing if you buy in amazon d'not worry about authentication bcoz MuscleBlaze all product are the sell form official MuscleBlaze company...just one suggestion for MuscleBlaze plz sand a gift as a shaker or t-shart...if you search any Indian brands so you go with MuscleBlaze..",127
Nirav d.,Best flavour i have ever tested & tasted till date,5,28-May-21,I have tried bunch of flavours but ordered this Mango flavour for the first time & believe me this is the best flavour i have ever tasted & just try with milk & you're gonna love it ...Just buy it,104
Vinuth,Just go for a change,4,12-Jun-21,"Generally for protein shakes, it's better to go with flavours that go well with milk. You can choose flavours like grape, strawberry and mango just for a change.But the problem is the flavour is too sweet and I felt like mango sugar taste and for slow absorption if you take it with milk then you have to consume within 5-7 mins as the milk breaks. Rest I find it good but I feel its contains some sugars (not mentioned on the container) as it's so sweet. In my opinion it's better to go with caffe mocca or chocolate if you don't mind the taste but if you want to try something new go for this. Btw it tastes so good with milk and when mixed with water it tastes like diluted copy products of maaza or fruity.",57
Biswajoy Ghosh,Best tasting,5,22-May-21,I bought the mango flavoured one. I have tried a number of whey protein supplements and a number of other flavours beside mango by MB itself. This one is by far the most natural tasting protein in my opinion. I mix a scoop with 200ml of chilled water and it tastes exactly like a pulpy mango drink. Will not change this flavour untill I am totally bored.,51
Babu lal,Fantastic,5,21 April 2021,Fantastic taste and great results. It helps me alot during my competition sessions. I put up almost 6 pound lean muscle mass. Loved it,50

Not sure if this bio-enzyme cleans up stomach.Update 3: I'm not sure if this is the right product for me. My stomach gets upset for 1-2 days after having one scoop.Update 4: Everytime I have taken this protein, I had upset stomach or diarrhoea.If you want to empty your bowels then this can be a good laxative.Threw away this after trying several times.",32
Prince jain,Know the things,5,15-Jul-21,I‚Äôve taken hazelnut chocolate flavour so 1st thing for most whey proteins or any bodybuilding supplements are not for all in some body they can give side effects or in some they can give very good effects so stop saying that this protein is right this protein is fake etc things so just take the whey protein don‚Äôt complain that the flavour is good flavour is not good etc you need gains your not drinking or taking thing for taste,28

Rohan,Low quality protein.

I regret ordering it.I‚Äôve been taking this for almost 15 days now and I‚Äôve not seen any improvement in my physique. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my muscles that I had gained in the last 1 month when I was taking Muscletech.I‚Äôve placed a new order for Muscletech and I won‚Äôt be taking Muscleblaze anymore.Please don‚Äôt waste your money on such low quality products.

The company should improve more on the taste for this flavour only.",5
AKHIL,Not good as expected,1,4-Aug-21,"Packing was bad.... the taste of mango flavor is same like a cheap 10rupees softdrink... doesn't feels like a protein shake...even we put 200ml for one scoop feels very lite,  not getting thick taste...I have used MB whey protein before.. by comparing between both its not good....Just okay...not for serious gymholics....",5
Pradip,This is good whey,4,11-Dec-21,I have tried a number of different whey brands in the last 7 years. My go to brand was Nitrotech. This time I decided on Muscleblaze Biozyme since they claimed Labdoor certification. So I bought a 1kg to try. I am quite impressed with the product. The taste is good and over the last month or so I haven‚Äôt seen any weight gain though my muscle mass has improved. Of course no one should expect wonders from any whey protein. This is only a supplement. The main thing is exercise and good diet.,2
Amazon Customer,It makes your stomach upset in just 3-4 days was not able to digest even water after consuming this,1,29-Mar-22,"Really pathatic customer service no return option will work as they will consume your time with mails and then will deny to return.

Sai kumar Mopurisetti,Very bad,1,29-Sep-21,"Headache, stomachache, bloating and lot of side effects on first day itself",8
Rudranil G.,One of the best,5,18-Jul-22,"After using it for 2 months I'm writing this review.It's one of the most recommended pdt in this category. And it shows. 1st the flavor is like chocolate Complan. A tip, if you mix it with more water (>the recommended amount) it tastes better. Also it tastes good with milk. Absorption was good too. I really saw muscle growth, that much I can vouch for. Take it post workout or daily basis for completing your protein needs. Never saw any problem with mixing or with digestion. Price is quite high though. So I'd not recommend this for students, but pros go for it.",2
vaiyavi v,Product is not mixing properly and creating lumps.,1,2-May-22,Product smells like a fermented liquid. I added 200ml cold water and one scoop of MB whey as per they instructed. Continuous and vigorous shaking also done. But lumps are formed and flavour also not good. I checked the authenticity of product but its verified one. Still not getting satisfaction from it. I dislike it,3
Dinesh Vandra,Mixing,3,21-Nov-21,"MuscleBlaze surely mixes some cheap quality protein in between or last on the top its the best quality proteinüíØüî• but i can feel the taste and after drinking there is some bubbles left in the shaker so its again a sign of mixing a cheap quality protein but those who cannot afford proteins like Optimum Nutrition, dynamite, gnc they can definitely go for it and i suggest you dont go for isolate its waste of money just by reducing 3-4g carbs how it will affect you for a lean gain but it cost 1000 rs more than this whey performance",2
Amrit Pal Sandhu,Too much artificial Sugar and Flavour,2,23-Jun-22,"Used it twice in a day. And I just can't understand why Indian brands use too much of Artificial Sweetner and Flavours....It tastes like you are having 4 tablespoons of Sugar in one drink, which also supress the choclate flavour.Digestion is good.After taste is awful.Packaging is good.Product is genuine no bloating and foul smell noticed.Will update the review after 15 days if use about results on body.Edit 1 (15 days of use)Visible growth in muscle and recovery. Lesser fatigue and higher stamina while exercise.Will not buy a flavored whey 8n future as it limits the options to miz it with juices or shakes. RAW whey gives you more freedom over options to use with other drinks.",One person found this helpful

Mahi,Overall good product!,5,2-Dec-21,So i am a normal person like you if you read this comment you will know all about the product so here is my poin of view i get this product in 2199 which is quite high price but the product worth it i have 60kg weight and i am 16 years old i order this becaouse i have regularly going to the gym there is no problem in absorption at all which i see in the comments so i will share my result after finishing it!,3
Amazon Customer,One of the worst protein experienced in last 10 years,1,27-Jul-22,Taste is too much sweet... Too much sugar present it seems and protein percentage very low. As it is raw protein is much better than this which I am using in parallel. I will not recommend it to anyone.,2

Misbah,Best ever protien,5,5-Aug-21,I have used this protien since 10 days and I can say that it's good protien it's taste is awesome also it digests quickly I have used almost all imported brands but this one is nest level better than asitis better than bigmuscle better than imported brands go for it but price is little bit costly on whey protien and biozyme whey isolate is very costly than imported brands I will recommend U only Biozyme performance whey coz it's in budget range but if u want to buy biozyme whey protien and biozyme whey isolate then please don't buy these two because imported brand price and these two price are almost same go only for biozyme performance whey,
Monu Banerjee,The Best Whey For Indian,5,21-Aug-21,"The media could not be loaded.
                
¬†I tried lots of variety in whey protein,but this protein is a one step upper then all other indian brand.I have been using MB Whey for a long time.And The result is great and if u use this whey or any MB product ,then u feel the rusult in one week.. and the best part of MuscleBlaze all information are clearly mention in product packaging..and one more best thing if you buy in amazon d'not worry about authentication bcoz MuscleBlaze all product are the sell form official MuscleBlaze company...just one suggestion for MuscleBlaze plz sand a gift as a shaker or t-shart...if you search any Indian brands so you go with MuscleBlaze..",
Nirav d.,Best flavour i have ever tested & tasted till date,5,28-May-21,I have tried bunch of flavours but ordered this Mango flavour for the first time & believe me this is the best flavour i have ever tasted & just try with milk & you're gonna love it ...Just buy it,
Vinuth,Just go for a change,4,12-Jun-21,"Generally for protein shakes, it's better to go with flavours that go well with milk. You can choose flavours like grape, strawberry and mango just for a change.But the problem is the flavour is too sweet and I felt like mango sugar taste and for slow absorption if you take it with milk then you have to consume within 5-7 mins as the milk breaks. Rest I find it good but I feel its contains some sugars (not mentioned on the container) as it's so sweet. In my opinion it's better to go with caffe mocca or chocolate if you don't mind the taste but if you want to try something new go for this. Btw it tastes so good with milk and when mixed with water it tastes like diluted copy products of maaza or fruity.",
Biswajoy Ghosh,Best tasting,5,22-May-21,I bought the mango flavoured one. I have tried a number of whey protein supplements and a number of other flavours beside mango by MB itself. This one is by far the most natural tasting protein in my opinion. I mix a scoop with 200ml of chilled water and it tastes exactly like a pulpy mango drink. Will not change this flavour untill I am totally bored.,
Babu lal,Fantastic,5,21 April 2021,Fantastic taste and great results. It helps me alot during my competition sessions. I put up almost 6 pound lean muscle mass. Loved it,
Deepak Dahiya,"Totally waste.. stomach problem, health issue",1,18-Jun-21,"It is totally waste product, creates stomach problem, anything you eat you just need to go for potty, harmful for digestion, i quit it just after 2 dose..even i had taken half scope first day and other half the next day, suddenly i stopped it because it is like a chemical. Don't use..waste of money.",
KG,If you want to empty your bowels then this can be a good laxative. Absolute GARBAGE.,1,12-Jul-21,"Mango flavour is mind blowing. I bought 1kg Mango flavour for the taste but will buy 2kg one next time.Easy to digest.Update 1 : after 5+ scoops this protein feels lighter on stomach as compared with others.Update 2 : I had a diarrhoea after 10+ scoops. Not sure if this bio-enzyme cleans up stomach.Update 3: I'm not sure if this is the right product for me. My stomach gets upset for 1-2 days after having one scoop.Update 4: Everytime I have taken this protein, I had upset stomach or diarrhoea.If you want to empty your bowels then this can be a good laxative.Threw away this after trying several times.",
Prince jain,Know the things,5,15-Jul-21,I‚Äôve taken hazelnut chocolate flavour so 1st thing for most whey proteins or any bodybuilding supplements are not for all in some body they can give side effects or in some they can give very good effects so stop saying that this protein is right this protein is fake etc things so just take the whey protein don‚Äôt complain that the flavour is good flavour is not good etc you need gains your not drinking or taking thing for taste,
AKHIL,Not good as expected,1,4-Aug-21,"Packing was bad.... the taste of mango flavor is same like a cheap 10rupees softdrink... doesn't feels like a protein shake...even we put 200ml for one scoop feels very lite,  not getting thick taste...I have used MB whey protein before.. by comparing between both its not good....Just okay...not for serious gymholics....",
Pradip,This is good whey,4,11-Dec-21,I have tried a number of different whey brands in the last 7 years. My go to brand was Nitrotech. This time I decided on Muscleblaze Biozyme since they claimed Labdoor certification. So I bought a 1kg to try. I am quite impressed with the product. The taste is good and over the last month or so I haven‚Äôt seen any weight gain though my muscle mass has improved. Of course no one should expect wonders from any whey protein. This is only a supplement. The main thing is exercise and good diet.,
Amazon Customer,It makes your stomach upset in just 3-4 days was not able to digest even water after consuming this,1,29-Mar-22,"Really pathatic customer service no return option will work as they will consume your time with mails and then will deny to return. They say they are not accaountable for rashes , stomach aches and tastes.Don't get trapped I invested 8299/- and now stuck with this waste powder which is of no use to me as it's making my stomach aches",
Sai kumar Mopurisetti,Very bad,1,29-Sep-21,"Headache, stomachache, bloating and lot of side effects on first day itself",
Rudranil G.,One of the best,5,18-Jul-22,"After using it for 2 months I'm writing this review.It's one of the most recommended pdt in this category. And it shows. 1st the flavor is like chocolate Complan. A tip, if you mix it with more water (>the recommended amount) it tastes better. Also it tastes good with milk. Absorption was good too. I really saw muscle growth, that much I can vouch for. Take it post workout or daily basis for completing your protein needs. Never saw any problem with mixing or with digestion. Price is quite high though. So I'd not recommend this for students, but pros go for it.",
vaiyavi v,Product is not mixing properly and creating lumps.,1,2-May-22,Product smells like a fermented liquid. I added 200ml cold water and one scoop of MB whey as per they instructed. Continuous and vigorous shaking also done. But lumps are formed and flavour also not good. I checked the authenticity of product but its verified one. Still not getting satisfaction from it. I dislike it,
Dinesh Vandra,Mixing,3,21-Nov-21,"MuscleBlaze surely mixes some cheap quality protein in between or last on the top its the best quality proteinüíØüî• but i can feel the taste and after drinking there is some bubbles left in the shaker so its again a sign of mixing a cheap quality protein but those who cannot afford proteins like Optimum Nutrition, dynamite, gnc they can definitely go for it and i suggest you dont go for isolate its waste of money just by reducing 3-4g carbs how it will affect you for a lean gain but it cost 1000 rs more than this whey performance",
Amrit Pal Sandhu,Too much artificial Sugar and Flavour,2,23-Jun-22,"Used it twice in a day. And I just can't understand why Indian brands use too much of Artificial Sweetner and Flavours....It tastes like you are having 4 tablespoons of Sugar in one drink, which also supress the choclate flavour.Digestion is good.After taste is awful.Packaging is good.Product is genuine no bloating and foul smell noticed.Will update the review after 15 days if use about results on body.Edit 1 (15 days of use)Visible growth in muscle and recovery. Lesser fatigue and higher stamina while exercise.Will not buy a flavored whey 8n future as it limits the options to miz it with juices or shakes. RAW whey gives you more freedom over options to use with other drinks.",
Raj,Geniune  product,5,20-Sep-21,Muscleblaze besest product no doubt i got the original product thanks for that i m looking forward to buy one more.. i ll give 5 out of 5 in taste‚Ä¶ 5/5 in mixabiliyy‚Ä¶5/5 in digestion‚Ä¶you will not feel much change in one jar but yeah yeah it complete your 20% protein in your diet üòã,
Mahi,Overall good product!,5,2-Dec-21,So i am a normal person like you if you read this comment you will know all about the product so here is my poin of view i get this product in 2199 which is quite high price but the product worth it i have 60kg weight and i am 16 years old i order this becaouse i have regularly going to the gym there is no problem in absorption at all which i see in the comments so i will share my result after finishing it!,
ìÜ©HimanshuìÜ™,ITS GENUINE PRODUCT ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,20-Jan-22,"Make sure before purchasing check who's the seller if it's MuscleBlaze then it will be 100% genuin product!  I choose this protein coz it's trurly Accurate with its content and before i have tried MB Fuel One Whey ( Chocolate ) it's better in taste as compared to Biozyme , And about results Yes FuelOne was good and satisfying Now I'll be trying Biozyme",
Smitking,One of the best protein powder out there,4,7-Jan-22,I am always on the hunt to try out the best protein powders in the market. I read some MuscleBlaze biozyme whey protein reviews online and gave it a try and there I am myself writing another one. The Product is fantastic with no bloating issues which i was facing with many protein powders. This is a must-have protein powder in your diet.,
Ankur,Not any review is perfect it is a perception game,4,7-Aug-22,Packing is so good but more important if some money saved from packing  and give it at  cheap to customer mixability great but not shown effect like on suppliment consumed one.month daily 1scoop .,

Emmanuel W.,Price hike,3,14-Jul-22,"The Muscle Blaze company seems to have excessively greedy, every now and then, increaseing the prices. I fear lest it should cause its fall and people go for an alternative since it is overrated also.",
Amarnath,It's an effective product.,4,18-Aug-21,MB Biozyme whey performance  is really a good product. It has a faster absorption rate in comparison to its previous products. The flavor of this product is quite good but it may not be good for everyone but can be bearable.  Yes it's value for money but it's should be less priced so that poor people also avail its benefits.,

Amazon Customer,Note the high amount of cadmium,1,27-Jan-22,"Their lab report mentions half the daily dose of cadmium in one scoop, so make sure to keep that in mind when taking this shake. I personally only took a few scoops I had 0 side-effects but probably best if avoided especially if you have a diet which already has some cadmium.",
DushyantSingh,Amazing mixability with great taste and packaging.,5,18-Sep-21,"I've been using muscleblaze from past 3 months and my experience is truly amazing, the taste is great it's affordable as well in this price range it's one of the best whey protein available along with the promising brand name of muscleblaze gives it even more and the bioenzyme certificate assures that also you can check the code and product by freshness seal.

Lekhi Singh,Excellent product,5,9-Feb-22,Very good product. Amazing taste. Mixability is also good plus good for digestion as it says.Gives a good amount of protein per scoop and most of people face problem of scoop getting inside the powder. Here Mb has innovative way to put a special spot on the top so that the scoop stays above the powder and its easy for you to use.,

Viktor,Genuinely easy to digest,5,16-Jul-22,This actually was really easy to digest compared to other wheys. I did have a slughtly stronger pump with On but this also has a decent amount of protein minus the isolate.,

Rich chocolate doesn't taste like chocolate at all, It feels way too sweet and nothing else. I'll stick with my raw whey from next time, Atleast it has flexibility to try different things with it",
Umang Uniya,Ok ok flavour,4,10-Jun-22,I generally buy MB supplement from long back. I hear about this kesar thandai flavour is very delicious but it's not met the expectations. All other things are fine. I recommend to go with chocolates or cookies and cream flavour.,
Rahul,Doubt whether its fake,1,29-Jun-22,I doubt whether the product is fake or not. As i can feel fine particles while mixing and drinking with water. I had used whey earlier and it should be creamy,
Amazon Customer,Pathetic quality whey,2,21-Jun-22,This is a very cheap quality whey..... Go for the expensive one rather than saving 500-1000rs.....you will regret it later.........

The other reviewers who say so are right. If I have this in morning it takes till evening for stomach to become normal.",
Adi,genuine product!,5,6-Oct-21,the item arrived a day late but nevertheless amazon customer service were kind enough to assure me every step of the way that the product will be genuine and I would get it at the earliest. I was worried because there were some reviews about adulteration. Websites like Nutristar do guarantee 100% genuine products but take too long to deliver. Hence I had chosen amazon.Delivery aside the product is really good.1. Excellent taste (chocolate hazelnut flavour)2. Excellent mixability even with milk3. Price on point,
T,"In my opinion, this is best for Indians. Great taste of chocolate and so are the results.",5,12-Aug-21,"#Great taste of chocolate and so are the results. #In my opinion this is best for Indians.#I have been using it since 2018. Also using BCAA from the MuscleBlaze and other products.# Among all other branded proteins available in the market, this gave me best results in muscle buildup.#Shows result within a week.",
Vishwas L.,Good product 100% that set,5,27-Jun-21,"Generally for protein shakes, it's better to go with flavours that go well with milk. You can choose flavours like grape, strawberry and mango just for a change.But the problem is the flavour is too sweet and I felt like mango sugar taste and for slow absorption if you take it with milk then you have to consume within 5-7 mins as the milk breaks. Rest I find it good but I feel its contains some sugars (not mentioned on the container) as it's so sweet. In my opinion it's better to go with caffe mocca or chocolate if you don't mind the taste but if you want to try something new go for this. Btw it tastes so good with milk and when mixed with water it tastes like diluted copy products of maaza or fruity.",
Gaurav Roy,Tastes like a mango drink. Surprisingly good !,5,2-Oct-21,One of the weirdest protein drink! Surprisingly sweet and snappy like an actual mango drink. Dissolves really well. I quite like this protein. Too early to comment on the result but for now hasn‚Äôt caused any side effect. Packaging is damn good as well. Even the quality and grade of container material is damn good.,
Sarthak,About the product.,5,14-Oct-21,"Okay, so this is the first time I started taking whey protein. I chose this because it's a very renowned Indian brand and of course promoted by NEERAJ CHOPRA.It's been 10 days using it, and it doesn't cause any bloating and indigestion. The absorbency, Flavor and quality of the whey are pretty good.If you want to lose weight, then I'll recommend you to go with ISOLATE WHEY PROTEIN.Overall, I like the product and will recommend you to go with it.Thanksü§úü§õ",

I regret the decision now. I had contemplated using the ""Subscribe and Save"" to get some discounts, but when they have no assurance on age of the product, it is pointless.Background: I ordered in Jan 2021 and got a product manufactured in June 2019. The expiry date for the box is June 2021. I did not check it prior to opening. Also it does not taste good (not like the previous ones I have had).

Noticed few changes in packaging. It clearly says FOR EXPORT ONLY and they are printing India's FSSAI green mark on label in USA. Feels like its substandard product. Manufacturing exclusively for people of India. I dnt know whats wrong but its definitely not On's Gold standard Whey that we had earlier. Discarding it and switching to Rule 1 or wild whey",
Khagendra,Read It,4,19-Dec-19,"Brand is famous and doesn't need any review however it is bit costly because of it's popularity.Take it but with safety.1. Never take more than necessary protein because excess protein can damage kidney. Yes we believe if we take extra, we will be stronger however it has side effects and shoud be consumed in safe limit.2. When you take protein you must drink minimum 3 litres of water. Again drinking excess water helps kidney to flush out excess urea and also excess unconsumed protein.3. When you don't excercise, don't take it. Many guys keep consuming it even after they don't go to gym or workout. Don't take it as a health nutrition.4. When you visit any gym, the gym trainer try to brainwash you to buy protein powder. Never listen to the gym guy because he gets commision to sell protein powder. If you really need, get one. Also don't buy the brand suggested by gym trainer. To get high commission they suggest you any other brand and they don't care about your health. They just care about their commision.Thanks for reading. Cheers!",
Mahak Jain,Excellent...!!,5,25-Oct-18,Oh my god....its the most delicious flavor you can ever get in protein powder...it tastes exactly like rich coffee..add some ice cubes to it when you make it with milk...it will taste exactly like rich smooth cold coffee..whenever i drink this protein powder i feel like i want more....or you can have it just plain with water....both tastes equally good....If you are really a coffee lover go for it...!!!!Best..best...!!!,

There is a major taste difference.2. There is something white powder mixed in this product which was not present in USA product.3. It doesn't blend in with water easily as compared to usa product4.

?Package quality of instruction sticker very bad for India manuf double chocolate flavour, looks compromised for cost when compared to imported. I hope similarly the inner content of protein powder is not compromised. Difficult to say now. Compromise is evident on brand sticker which in itself is a proof that there may be compromise on quality for more profits, as the local manuf and plus is still same price, then why consumers to buy localised product with quality compromise. We may buy some other brand which is imported as In india the food quality checks cannot be trusted and stringent as USA quality. Very bad, now we can't trust the system authentication as the system authenticated product itself looks compromised. Manufactured in India was hidden by a sticker for some reason I don't know why.

Following are the things you need to check and that determines the authenticity.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. The Seal. ON has it's black seal with golden ON hologram on it. It's the part of plastic and isn't any sticker.2. The Spelling mistake. ISOLATE & ISOLATES both are AUTHENTIC. ISOLATE is from USA & ISOLATES is from UK.3. The Bright Commodities Sticker and Scratch code which you can check by visiting their website.4. The BOX doesn't come with INNER SEAL. If you don't find SEAL INSIDE THEN IT IS AUTHENTIC.5. The INSIDE of the CAP. It has MADE IN USA written on it.6. The ON LOGO on the SCOOP. If the SCOOP HAS ON LOGO then it's AUTHENTIC.7. The MFD on the tub which will be TWO YEARS DIFFERENCE and WHEN SCRATCHED, IT GOES.8. The MIXABILITY of the powder, IT WILL GET MIXED VERY EASILY IN 30 SECONDS.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------IF you get all the above things right then your product is AUTHENTIC.The product is really good and i could see the RESULTS FROM DAY ONE itself and it TASTES GOOD but the taste stays in your mouth for a while. I just use a glass and a spoon to mix and it MIXES IN 30 SECONDS leaving NO LUMPS.It FEELS LIGHT and DOESN'T BLOAT.

It's not but to be on a safer side I went and thoroughly researched all the details. In India, there are 2 official distributers, Glanbia and Bright commodities. Glanbia's official distributor partner for Amazon is cloudtail. So I don't think anyone should worry product authenticity. Just make sure of three things-1.The scratch code is totally unscratched when received2. The lid has a golden hologram of ON3. The Scoop inside is transparent.Don't worry about anything else.Enjoy the shake! Smells and tastes wonderful???Hope this helps",

akshay kumar,Genuine product,5,30-Dec-17,"Brought this product through the seller cloudtail. I checked through few ways and found it to be a genuine product.How to identify:1. Check if there is a hologram (golden colour) at the cap2. Look for the manufacturing details and batch code at the bottom of the bottle . It should be in blue colour . The manufacturing date should be of a difference of 2 years exactly .3. Check for any spelling mistakes4. Scan the QR code and make sure it leads to their original site .5. Inside the bottle , there will be a scoop and it should be in golden colour with the ON logo .6.

I will recommend to those who are doing workout, gyming or exercises and require high protein content for muscle building. If you can complete your required protein content by food like eggs, chicken breasts, etc then there is no need of this protein powder. Therefore don?? buy it blindly, firstly do analyse your body protein needs, workout goals and daily protein intake you are getting currently then go for it. No issues with the product and the brand as it is 100% genuine of Optimum Nutrition.",
Anurag,Good Quality Whey Protein,5,25-Jul-22,I purchased this product multiple times. Tast is ok for me. I check the authenticity code and packing after doing all the outer inspection its time to check the inside stuff. As we all know pure protein is not heat soluble so I would take some water in a cup put 1 to 2 teaspoon of the whey protein powder mix it and put it in the microwave for 2 mins. After two mins you will find the powder has turned into solid in indian language it will be like (fata hua dudh). We are set and ready to use the product tension free and focus on working out and putting extra effort.,
Antra Maurya,Changes in Authenticity check,4,10-Jan-22,So I watched a lot of YouTube videos regarding ON authenticity.My product did not have an importer tag also there was no blue expiry date on the bottom.So I called ON customer support and the agent mentioned below points-1. Glanbia (importer) now imports raw material from US and packaging is done in India. I guess the plant is in Himachal and established some 6 months back.2. There will be no importer tag in new ON boxes.3. Expiry date and batch number is now printed on back of the box in a white space with black ink and not on the bottom.4.No vaccum cover on the lid intead a pasted seal.5. Check authenticity by the TRU SEAL (which we all do).,

Skt,Worst experience,1,13-Feb-21,"Ordered on 5 Feb and received 8 Feb .I could not authenticate the product and the customer care did the authentication of the product on my behalf ! I wonder what different procedure they did and it got authentication right as there are only 2 ways to do so ..I opened the jar and it had no seal in the inside to protect it from moisture ..I was not able to mix it well with the water ..The smell is something weird and also taste is something like a cough syrup nothing like a double chocolate..The consistency is too wattery after mixing.The 10 Days Return / Replacement is a total scam with this product , so don't believe what the tab below the product says! As you try to get it replaced or try to return it, they can only connect you to the Amazon customer care who in turn will ask  to mail and connect with the manufacturer.Overall not worth and a disappointment.

Some powder leaked out. I could actually tighten the cap even without opening the seal. One thing I don't like about ON is that the tubs don't look premium and the seal system is inferior to the price we pay.About this purchase, I think it is genuine. I have checked the 6-digit code in the website. Moreover it looks, feels and tastes exactly like the ones I normally purchase in the UAE.About the flavor(Rocky Road), it is good, but I still think 'Double Rich Chocolate' and 'Chocolate Malt' are better.",

George,"Scoop is different, not Golden .flavor rocky roads",2,14-Jul-21,"Product seems genuine. The only worry was the scoop is a transparent scoop with no logo on it. People who use Opitimum will be aware of the Golden scoop with Logo. I authenticated the product on Optimum website as well as had a call with the customer care- they told me due to environmental concerns the plastic  for the scoop is now transparent. Doesn't make sense at all? Taste wise is Ok.. flavours can be same as the actual rocky road, nor do other flavours except for the generic onces i.e vanilla, chocolate etc. Giving it 2 stars as of now, because of the scoop and the explanation given to me.",

Nitish Negi,A very well presented FAKE powder,1,19-Jul-18,"Well this is a very well done FAKE product.Now you guys must be wondering that how am I this sure about the quality of the product.So here it goes.I have been consuming this product from the last 1 year. And every time I have asked my known ones to get it from any GNC store in USA.So from the beginning I have consumed the genuine product.And now comes the interesting part. Why I am sure that this product is not Genuine.So the one I ordered from here was sweet like a chocolate powder that is used to make chocolate shake. The original GNC one I ordered was not sweet at all. It tasted all bland. Moreover the Sugar Content in the ingredients of the packing is 1gram per serving. Low enough that you just won't taste it. Just as in case of the GNC one.Also, when I first opened the jar, there were a hell lot of white particles all around the powder that were not mixed. I never saw anything like this in my previous protein of same make and type.Checkout the image I have attached.Another one was the powder seemed to be as if moisture has had its effect on it. The one I consumed from GNC was just like ""Maida"" with not moisture.Now at last, this is a very well presented fake product.Think I am just defaming it? Go ahead! Buy it.I don't care if you still want to have it.But would love to at least speak it out and help someone who isn't aware of such things.Peace!EDIT: Tried placing a replacement order just to see if I accidentally received the fake one. But to my surprise, it was 'MORE FAKE' than the previous one. This time, not only the powder but the whole packaging was copied and was fake. There was ""S"" missing in the ""ISOLATES"" in from on the box. Also, there was a difference in the design of the label.Have placed a return now.",

BeLiVE,"Hey, it's ON!!",5,12-Nov-17,"After taking suggestions from my gym's pros, who are in to fitness from more than 2years, I ordered this. Like others, I was also in doubt whether the product will be original or duplicate cos duplicates are also available in market. But guys this product is 100% original and I showed to my gym trainer also. It mixes well with water and you can bear it's taste as well.  In the product description they have mentioned few guidelines just to make sure the product is original. Make sure you see the expiry date as well. It was delivered on the expected date with a very good packaging. Totally loved it!",
Srivas,Great Protein powder; mediocre flavor (Rocky Road),4,28-Oct-15,"I have always used Optimum Nutrition as my primary source of protein. I find it better than most other brands, and even though it's quite expensive, I feel that the extra price you pay is worth it.I have always used the Vanilla flavor, and this time, thought I'd shake things up a bit and try a different flavor for a change. Rocky Road is good, but a bit too creamy, in my opinion. Maybe my taste buds are just used to vanilla, but the Rocky Road flavor always leaves an aftertaste in my mouth, which I don't like at all. If you're getting it, I suggest getting some other flavor.Vanilla, Chocolate and Cappuccino are all great flavors.The product itself is original, and came with the authentication sticker (Seller: Primarc Pecan Retail; They are the official importers in India for ON). I don't know why so many people claim to have gotten a spurious product, because I always order this from Amazon, and have never received a duplicate.",
Shubhadeep Mukhopadhyay,TAKE TIME & READ THE WHOLE REVIEW THOROUGHLY. I hope you will find every tiny detail that you want/need in this review.,4,21-Mar-18,"I WILL GIVE THE FULL REVIEW POINT BY POINT (with attached Photos). ENJOY AND KEEP READING, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.Just to clarify and to be honest, this is the first time I'm using a Whey protein, not just the brand but Whey protein itself. Though, I was very skeptical about the purchase after reading so many reviews about the product being fake, I still decided to order it.ABOUT THE JAR/TUB (AUTHENTICITY CHECK from the outside): There was a strong chocolate smell on the outside of the jar already. I checked the bottom of the jar and the tub looked normal. Mfd and Exp date had exactly 2 years gap. I did not find any tampering marks whatsoever.There was the ""ON Authentic seal"" on the neck band. I checked everything thoroughly before opening it. The QR code on the jar itself led me to product page of Optimum Nutrition website.The QR code on the importer sticker led me to Bright Commodities authenticity checking page. I scratched the Importer sticker for the hidden code and entered all the details and it said that the product is authentic.After opening the jar, I did find the seal attached on the lid.The jar was kind of half filled, not up to the brim. (Doubt 1)I also found the golden scoop with the branding on it and Made in USA written inside the scoop along with some other details.SMELL, CONSISTENCY AND TEXTURE OF THE POWDER: The power smelled nice and the texture was normal I think (First time user), not clumpy or anything.No stickiness at all, the powder did not stick to the inside of the jar. (Authenticity checking method found somewhere online)One thing that I noticed was that, the powder had some white particles in it. (Doubt 2)Now, to clear out my doubts I called 011-49594959 which was Glanbia Performance Nutrition. I followed the instructions given by the IVR and asked about my doubts. The customer executive was helpful enough and told that ""The product is 100% authentic. The jar is supposed to be filled half way and the white particles are 'Amino Acids'.""I was satisfied with all the authenticity checking and all.TASTE: Though it smelled really chocolaty, the taste was just okay. According to me, it had a medicinal taste to it.Consistency was okay, not thick at all, it might just be the amount of water I added. (1 full scoop in one glass of water)MIXABILITY: It mixed with the water fairly easily. Found 1 tiny lump, and by ""tiny"" I really mean tiny, most of the people won't even notice it probably. I noticed it because I was trying to find lumps intentionally. Now, keep in mind that I did not use a shaker, it was simply stirred with a spoon in a glass. I did not even stir vigorously. So, mixability is good I think.RATING: Now, talking about the rating, I gave it a 4* just because the taste was okay.",
Amrut,FULL REVIEW,5,9-Oct-17,"First of all would like to appreciate amazon for the fast delivery, cuz I got the product in 1 day of ordering.I was worried after seeing the reviews that my whey could turn out to be fake and I will regret buying from Amazon but it turned out to be genuine and although the Amazon seller was Cloudtailindia the product is indeed imported by Bright commodities which is the official importer of ON in india. To check the authenticity of the whey always watch videos on YouTube regarding ""how to identify fake ON whey from original one's"" before buying so that you can check it quickly once it arrives.Make sure on the day of the delivery you install a QR and barcode scanner app on your smartphone to quickly scan the codes on the tub which will take you to the official ON Website. As of the whey itself I'm completely relieved because it genuine and it's a trusted and no. 1 brand through the decade.i'd ordered double rich choc.My review on the product :1)TASTE - 8/102)MIXABILITY - 9/10 (always mix w/ cold water/milk)3)QUALITY - 10/104) EFFICIENCY* - 9/10..*efficiency could relate from person to person since it's based on many factors such as age, workout intensity,diet, dedication etc.dont expect to build a muscular body without working out hardcore in the gym and maintaining a healthy diet of egg whites,chicken,veggies and protein shake(remember it's a supplement not a whole food)THANK YOU.if any doubts feel free to dm me on Insta - amrut_p49",

Leila,A good source of quality PROTEIN!,4,28-Nov-14,"The product has a rich pleasant flavour. More importantly, it mixes very easily and there are no lumps. The measure scoop is handy. For those seeking good quality protein supplement and have a taste for chocolate - well, Optimum Protein 100% Whey is the answer. The pricing is a little on the high side which may put off younger groups with less fat wallets.",
shrinivas patil,Good product with excellent service by Amazon,4,28-Mar-15,I bought this Amazon fulfilled product. It was sealed perfectly leaving no doubt oftampering. Amazon service was excellent and I received the product on time. The protein is good in taste and provides the required energy for workout as well as a good energy replenisher post workouts. It mixes well with water with no granules left behind. The chocolate flavour is good and is not too sweet . I am satisfied with the product .,
Amazon Customer,Fake Product,1,10-Oct-17,"Usually I order via health cart and products were good. The current product taste bad, does not mix well and no way a original product. Amazon must take extra protection so that consumer are not duped or money more importantly health. Will never take risk with these kinds of products at Amazon. Very very disappointed.",

Many a days I go to the gym just to have this great tasting drink!! 100% satisfied.. Exceeded my expectations!!!",
Naveenkumar,Orignal product and few things need to be known,5,6-Aug-15,"Received Original product. had Hologram in nect of the Jar. I like to share few things for the below questions and which degrades the quality of the seller and ON  and for the negative comments we see in net.1)No hologram on the 1 lb - I have seen complaints about the Primarc pecan sellar. What I believe is, They dont sell fake product and damage their brand name. People search for hologram in 1 lbs jar and they say its fake product since they dont find them. actually 1 lbs doesnt come with Hologram since it's almost like a trial pack. you can simply confirm the authenticity from the Aroma when u open the Jar. (They didnt update the images- the product u receive might have 23g of protein which is not gold standard)2) Jar is not sealed inside - To verify this, I have searched couple of vids of unpacking the ON 2lbs in which White lid is not sticked and covered the Jar opening instead it was attached to the cap. So dont think u have a fake product when u see the white lid is attached with the cap of jar.3) I dont see the result - I am not sure why guys are expecting so much outta it. It s just a supplement. You gotta eat healthy and must be taking proper amount of protein, fat and carbs with proper workout routine. If u miss out any one of this, you will not see proper result. some body structure may not digest this supplement as expected. In worst case, U might not see the result :( (You can skip the Supplement and it can be compensated with Proper foods).Some tips- Eat - Egg white, Whole wheat bread, chicken breast, oats(complex carbs) ,avoid sat fat and trans fat and drink at least 5 lts of water per day. All the best Guys..",
Durgesh Kothari,Good product although I prefer Dymatize for taste,4,31-May-15,"Nice product but the taste is just ok. I prefer Dymatize Caf? Mocha as the taste is much richer and tastier. I definitely feel stronger since using whey protein. On bodybuilding.com a US site, they rated ON as one of the best brands. I don't trust the Indian brands although cheaper because they aren't properly regulated or testing in India.",

Rajiv Pillai,Great to taste with a promising nutrition,4,14-May-14,"For a first timer, I must admit that the taste of Double Chocolate is definitely good. It's too early and too little to comment about the health benefits but hopefully it should be great as well. The only drawback as compared to Nutrilite Protein Powder, is that this isn't a family protein powder. You can't give it to children below 18 who need protein equally well.",
PS,Simply awesum number 1 product always,5,25-Jan-16,"One of the finest whey protein supplement we have in the market is this one, i am using it from past 4-5 months and i must say that i saw a huge difference in my muscle gain ability, yeah it also depends what diet you are taking , but this supplement is best even bodybuilding.com also announced it number 1 product, so without even thinking just go for it you will start feel the difference in muscle gain within one month.",

SudR,Fake and disappointing even amazon couldn't guarantee the quality.,1,13-Jan-18,Bought this product from cloudtail and tried with just 6 oz of water. Recommended water level is 6 to 8oz.. Its totally run down and there is not a bit of chocolate taste in mix.  Extremely unhappy with the fake ones sold even on a site like amazon.. They conveniently marked the product as non returnable.. Very upsetting to see how low they are reaching to make money even on food items.,
Akhil P Walia,Best Whey,5,26-Sep-16,Genuine import and tastes good.

Received my order in just 2 days.NOTE: If you want to check whether the product is Original, use the QR Code on the box. When you scan it, it should direct you to the official ON website with all the details about your product.

OEL,Disappointed!,1,1-Dec-17,"It was not sealed when delivered, anyone could adulterate it therefore the experience started with shaky confidence. Taste really bad, so bad that my body immediately rejected it by puking it out. I ordered chocolate flavour but all I got was sawdust and so it further reinforced My vote of no confidence for the product. Then I finally lost complete confidence when it had no result. I have been using this for over 2 months and nothing. My previous protein had better result within a month. I will go back to using that. so to encapsulate...1- Wasn't sealed, 2-Taste like sawdust, 3- No result. What do you think I bought ?",
Amazon Customer,Just outer Seal?,4,16-Dec-15,Everything was fine until I found out that inner seal was missing. However when I searched about this issue many say that it will be packed either with inner or outer seal with ON Hologram and the whey powder will give out strong odour when opened and yes it did. When I verified the product with ON and ON distributors in India and said my product is genuine and also from the links it matches how real product this is to be when I crosschecked with fake Whey. So guys container should have either inner or outer seal.,

The taste too was a bit different. I am not able to point out exactly how. Now I had been taking This for last three days and soon after consuming it I start feeling gaseous and rumbling in the stomach. Since yesterday I have developed loose motion. Haven?? changed my diet any other way. So a bit worried about the authenticity of the product. I have been taking whey protein for more than 6 months now. Never have I had a trouble before this.,
Gaurav bhargav,I feel like refunding.,1,6-Oct-16,I feel they are selling fake powder...I feel like refunding...absolutely no taste present in the powder ...I bought a chocolate flavor ...have bought others before...but getting a feeling of  this product to be tampered,

It's the world's most trusted brand of whey isolate, but don't go in expecting to see visible results in a short time without working out at a comparable intensity. The only immediate benefit I can see with this supplement is that my recovery from delayed onset muscle soreness syndrome (DOMS) has massively increased, to less than 24 hours, so I can work out the same body part much faster than before.",

I checked the product on bright commodities and it showed that my product is authentic but I don't know I still have some issues. May be in India these products are not actually authentic.

Vaibhav Marathe,The best whey protein since 11 years,5,30-Nov-17,"On Gold Standard 100% Whey protein is continuously winning awards from 11 years as the best isolate whey protein and i'm using it from 2 years the best ever whey protein with the best results you get. Well talking about the flavour that it has More than 18 different flavours than any other whey protein manufacturer has.For better results take it immediately after your workout and try to take minimum 2 to 3 scoops daily as i take 1 scoop one hour later in morning after breakfast mixed with yoghurt and 1.5 scoop after workout in evening but keep in mind don't eat for 1 hour after consuming it let it get digested and then take your meals otherwise you are wasting your whey protein.Tips to find the product is genuine or not1. Lot Number : Every optimum nutrition product has a lot number which signifies that it belongs to the original ON product batch. This number can be found on the bottom of the jar.2. MFG and Expiry Date : Always check manufacturing date and expiry date. An expired product is of no use because it can give you serious side effects.3. Product Label : ON Gold Standard 100% Whey?? product label is printed with dark and vibrant colors with a shiny and smooth finish. You should check the label thoroughly, it should not look flimsy. It also lists 24g WPI, 5.5g BCAAs and 4g Glutamine. You should check that this info is correct on your label.4. Grammatical Errors : There is no room for grammatical errors on Optimum Nutrition?? product label. If you find any errors on the product label then it is fake.5. Check Seal : The container should be sealed properly from outside especially the lid is properly sealed if ON Gold 100 Whey is genuine. The seal is shiny and also the lead. Do not accept if there is no seal.6. Check Manufacturer?? Address : All ON products are mostly manufactured in the USA, so your Whey protein container should have the USA manufactures address. Check the back of the container.7. Scan The Bar Code : On the jar you will find a QR code and a bar code. Just scan these codes with your smartphone by using a QR code scanning app. It will show you product details.

Rajendra kumar Das,ON,5,1-Jul-20,ON gold standard is a perfect consists of protin bcaa glutamine intake of ON whey protein to beginners is a best way to boost the muscles and chocolate flavor has good taste.,

Amazon_Shopper,Best whey protein on earth. Tips to find out the fake ones.,5,25-Mar-17,"First of all I didn't buy this whey protein from Amazon. I bought it from authorized neulife store. Double Rich Chocolate is the best flavor of ON 100% Whey and has a mouth watering taste even with water. Milk gives more rich taste and you will feel that you just have eaten a double chocolate drink. Its taste is awesome.Now I am here to tell you guys about spotting the fake ON Whey protein and also I will address some misconceptions about this product which are unnecessarily degrading its value.Tips to check the genuine ON Whey1. First of all if you are worried about the genuinity then I would suggest you buy ON protein only from three sources. These three sources are neulife online store (neulife online store), neulife retail store, and finally Cloudtail India on Amazon. There is no doubt that neulife is the oldest importer of ON products in India so you can buy from them with confidence. I contacted Glanbia India customer care and they have confirmed this that neulife directly imports ON products from Glanbia and they also said that Cloudtail India is also their trusted ON whey seller. If you are buying from Cloudtail and getting ON Whey with a 'Bright commodities' sticker then it's all genuine.2. Neulife has a better system of verifying their ON Whey products. Every neulife ON Whey product has a unique code, QR code that you have to scan or SMS to neulife to verify it. I instantly got a message that ""My ON whey is genuine"". You can only verify it once though.3. The double rich chocolate flavor is awesome and when you mix it with water it forms a white creamy layer and taste if awesome exactly like double rich chocolate.4. If you are mixing one scoop with little water then it will the real chocolate taste with very very little bitterness exactly like a dark chocolate. It is sweet also. The bitterness is sometimes unnoticeable, this bitterness feels exactly the same on tongue after eating a dark chocolate.5. DRC flavor smells like chocolate and have tiny white in it.6. Comes with golden seal which is printed on the black label.Misconceptions:Some people say that they are getting fake supplements and half of the powder is fake. Some also say that the sellers cut the container from the bottom and remove the original powder and fill it with some fake powder. But I checked my container from inside after emptying it and found that the bottom is intact from inside and no sign of cutting the container was found. Please check attached images for clarification.But if you buy from neulife then there is no problem. Cloudtail India sells genuine ON whey as confirmed by Glanbia Performance Nutrition, but I can't say about the delivery agents. Buying supplements online are also not good in summers as these supplements need cool places to store while during transit the whey powder go though heat which may degrade its quality.If you are going to GYM then stay away from trainer's advice over this and never buy even if he gives you heavy discounts. This gym trainers will never give you the protein imported legally, they will either sell you grey market stuff which is mostly fake or they sell you supplements that are imported from unknown sources. Stay away from these fake trainers if you love your body.I was shocked to know that my GYM trainer doesn't know about neulife.So buy your protein from neulife or cloudtail only. Also stay away from low quality supplements like MuscleBlaze, don't get fooled in the name of made in India whey protein. ON is the best whey protein in the world. It is light on stomach and won't give you headaches or stomach pain. It is digested easily and helps in muscle building.Attached images for more info.",

Abbas Shirazi,The caffeine content per scoop is very proportional to the protein per scoop we get.,4,7-Oct-19,"Firstly, i would rate this particular product 9/10 as compared to other whey proteins of ON.This mocha cappuccino tastes fantastic, I liked it a lot. It is far better than the chocolate flavored.The mixiblity is same as other wheys.It blends as well.Overall, it is best suitable for beginners and intermediate body builders.",
Nikhil,Good so far,5,5-Jun-18,Ordered this after I got a recommendation from my Gym coach. Got this the next day with amazon prime. Verified the authenticity.

My aim is to lose fat. Should see how it goes after a month. I?? so far satisfied with the product.,

The container has an outside seal with ON authentic hologram, once you remove that seal, there will be no inner seal, so don't worry and enjoy the product... I thought I will clarify this as many people are thinking it is fake due to non presence of inner seal... If the Seal is tampered or broken it is then advisable to return the product...Also to add on, servings depend on flavors, each flavor might have different servings so do not again assume that you got fake product...

Prime Customer,Use common sense,2,17-Aug-17,"You dont need supplements to build muscle.Because for body weight of 76kg you need nearly 150g of protein.And whey protein gives 24g for 1scoop so if 2lb is around Rs.3000 each scoop costs Rs.100 and you are still at deficit of neatly 135g.Chicken is even better a kilo costs Rs 130 and boneless breasts costs Rs. 200 and 100gm of the same costs Rs 20 and gives 31g of protein and 1gm fat. So having twice gives you 61gm of protein and costs Rs. 40 and with milk, eggs & oats, roti/chapati & rajma/channa/chole gives you full protein daily requirement all totalling under Rs. 100.So it makes no sense to buy supplements. Its like this as if you drinking horlicks makes you taller stronger and sharper and you've been drinking it since your childhood and you know the results.I am not saying taking supplements wont build muscles it does actually. But it makes no difference if you take chicken or egg or whey protein or milk. Protein is protein.All that matters is meeting your daily protein requirement of nealy 1.5 or 2gm of protein / kg of body weight and incase you are deficit in your daily requirement of say 25g you supplement it with supplements hence the name supplements ie you complete your deficit gap by supplementing it with shakes.And it makes no sense to make it as primary protein food and drink 6 scoops to meet such requirement spend Rs.10000 a month when normal food costs under Rs. 1500 and meets all your requirement.People in US usually take 2 scoops not because whey protein builds more muscle but because a pound of chicken or ~450g costs 6-8 dollars which can make up for 2 or 3 servings or one to one and half days so for a month it costs them considering $7 as average it costs $210. So in US whey protein is cheaper but in india chicken is cheaper.Its all consumerism they want you to buy so that they can make money.WRT preworkout creatine it makes no difference its just placebo effect. Ive used it for 2 years. Your strength grows naturally over time with or without creatine just eat proper normal food. And there is no better pre workout than a banana/rice",

Aryan Padhy,Great experience. Quality ???,5,2 April 2021,I think the flavour is a bit concentrated. Expected a milder flavour . Researched that it's the best flavour. Best Taste is subjective.I think chocolate banana would be better. Regarding the authenticity and quality of the product I have no doubt. Amazing work Amazon and cloudtail. It passes every verification procedure. Also the product has validity till 2022,
Sho,Ok ok product,2,4-Jul-21,ON is too costly and gives same effect like muscleblaze. Main issue with ON is they are not researching on this product and bloating issue with this product is still not resolved. ON should improve this product by adding stevia and digestive enzymes.,

Yellowflash,Fake supplement alert,1,26-Jan-19,"Ordered the product on january sale and recieved today on 26th jan I was happy as I bought it for a very low price than the market and as soon as I got my hands on the product I opened it the first thing that shocked me that there is no interior lid covering this was strange and unusual as the product always comes with a interior lid although the seal was intact so I thought everything is right but as soon I smelled it my doubt on the authenticity of the product becomes crystal clear, I took one scoop and mixed it with water bingo it is not mixing with water. I dont know how this happens as the seal is from On is intactand also the distrubutor seal is also ok but how could this happen I cant understand that, abd from now no protein from internet.

A Buyer,STALE stock: expire in 6 months (total 24 month). Suspected authenticity too - only box is authentic,1,4-Jan-21,"IT IS IMPORTANT TO UPVOTE RECENT REVIEWS TO ENSURE QUALITY IS MAINTAINEDI ordered ON 1 KG after a lot of deliberation. I regret the decision now. I had contemplated using the ""Subscribe and Save"" to get some discounts, but when they have no assurance on age of the product, it is pointless.Background: I ordered in Jan 2021 and got a product manufactured in June 2019. The expiry date for the box is June 2021. I did not check it prior to opening. Also it does not taste good (not like the previous ones I have had). It probably was not stored right as the TASTE HAS GONE BAD. Will not buy this ever again from Amazon.The authentication sticker validates the box - But the box itself is not tamperproof and the seal is more like a heat-shrink seal. Not sure it is authentic.",67
Prabhjot,"Substandard, Made Exclusively for INDIA",2,21-Aug-18,"I am taking  On's Gold standard since years.i can't say its grey market product but definately something wrong this time. Bright commodities said its genuine product when i sent scratch code but its mixability is really bad, not even mixing with shaker and taste is less chocolaty,i dnt feel any heavyness in stomach after having it. Noticed few changes in packaging. It clearly says FOR EXPORT ONLY and they are printing India's FSSAI green mark on label in USA. Feels like its substandard product. Manufacturing exclusively for people of India. I dnt know whats wrong but its definitely not On's Gold standard Whey that we had earlier. Discarding it and switching to Rule 1 or wild whey",119
Khagendra,Read It,4,19-Dec-19,"Brand is famous and doesn't need any review however it is bit costly because of it's popularity.Take it but with safety.1. Never take more than necessary protein because excess protein can damage kidney. Yes we believe if we take extra, we will be stronger however it has side effects and shoud be consumed in safe limit.2. When you take protein you must drink minimum 3 litres of water. Again drinking excess water helps kidney to flush out excess urea and also excess unconsumed protein.3. When you don't excercise, don't take it. Many guys keep consuming it even after they don't go to gym or workout. Don't take it as a health nutrition.4. When you visit any gym, the gym trainer try to brainwash you to buy protein powder. Never listen to the gym guy because he gets commision to sell protein powder. If you really need, get one. Also don't buy the brand suggested by gym trainer. To get high commission they suggest you any other brand and they don't care about your health. They just care about their commision.Thanks for reading. Cheers!",61
Mahak Jain,Excellent...!!,5,25-Oct-18,Oh my god....its the most delicious flavor you can ever get in protein powder...it tastes exactly like rich coffee..add some ice cubes to it when you make it with milk...it will taste exactly like rich smooth cold coffee..whenever i drink this protein powder i feel like i want more....or you can have it just plain with water....both tastes equally good....If you are really a coffee lover go for it...!!!!Best..best...!!!,77

As we all know pure protein is not heat soluble so I would take some water in a cup put 1 to 2 teaspoon of the whey protein powder mix it and put it in the microwave for 2 mins. After two mins you will find the powder has turned into solid in indian language it will be like (fata hua dudh).

Skt,Worst experience,1,13-Feb-21,"Ordered on 5 Feb and received 8 Feb .I could not authenticate the product and the customer care did the authentication of the product on my behalf ! I wonder what different procedure they did and it got authentication right as there are only 2 ways to do so ..I opened the jar and it had no seal in the inside to protect it from moisture ..I was not able to mix it well with the water ..The smell is something weird and also taste is something like a cough syrup nothing like a double chocolate..The consistency is too wattery after mixing.The 10 Days Return / Replacement is a total scam with this product , so don't believe what the tab below the product says! As you try to get it replaced or try to return it, they can only connect you to the Amazon customer care who in turn will ask  to mail and connect with the manufacturer.Overall not worth and a disappointment. Don't buy this product online !!",3

Ashok,Manufactured in India?,1,11-Sep-20,"Follow IG: bodybuilding_supplement_stackI was told by the customer care at amazon that ON was fully imported from either US or UK, the only place where they have manufacturing plants but a simple google search shows Tirupati Sports Nutrition company manufactures ON and other brands right here in India. The bottle looks authentic but the powder inside was a little off. Maybe it got damaged in Indian weather conditions. Or maybe it?? Indian ON. I don?? know.

Some powder leaked out. I could actually tighten the cap even without opening the seal. One thing I don't like about ON is that the tubs don't look premium and the seal system is inferior to the price we pay.About this purchase, I think it is genuine. I have checked the 6-digit code in the website. Moreover it looks, feels and tastes exactly like the ones I normally purchase in the UAE.About the flavor(Rocky Road), it is good, but I still think 'Double Rich Chocolate' and 'Chocolate Malt' are better.",2

The product was indeed genuine.On Amazon.in, Make sure you're ordering from ONLY verified distributors :For example, Cloudtail India.Go to the official site of Optimum Nutrition to see how to check the authenticity of the product and register it.Impressions:The texture was kind of powdery.After trying the powder, sense of my taste and smell was gone for weeks.

However, the worst oerid was when I was using ON as I couldn't see ny results and just feel tired and seems like protein was not doing the job. I realise this as I switched to Dynamo and I could feel the difference in a week. So I have to give it has to do with the product as I have been regular in my schedule.

Akshay Patel,Not mixing well,1,9-Mar-22,"On the product, it says that Stir, shake, or blend until dissolved. But the product isn't dissolving at all. There are lumps left on the top which are not able to dissolve. Additional, there is some kind of layer of form after mixing with milk (mixing with water also has only a little layer of form and will taste like hell, will not be able to drink that). I don't know whether it is an original product or duplicate (yes, I checked on that website and it says Authentic Product but can't believe that).",1

George,"Scoop is different, not Golden .flavor rocky roads",2,14-Jul-21,"Product seems genuine. The only worry was the scoop is a transparent scoop with no logo on it. People who use Opitimum will be aware of the Golden scoop with Logo. I authenticated the product on Optimum website as well as had a call with the customer care- they told me due to environmental concerns the plastic  for the scoop is now transparent. Doesn't make sense at all? Taste wise is Ok.. flavours can be same as the actual rocky road, nor do other flavours except for the generic onces i.e vanilla, chocolate etc. Giving it 2 stars as of now, because of the scoop and the explanation given to me.",1

The expiry date for the box is June 2021. I did not check it prior to opening. Also it does not taste good (not like the previous ones I have had).

Again drinking excess water helps kidney to flush out excess urea and also excess unconsumed protein.3. When you don't excercise, don't take it. Many guys keep consuming it even after they don't go to gym or workout. Don't take it as a health nutrition.4. When you visit any gym, the gym trainer try to brainwash you to buy protein powder. Never listen to the gym guy because he gets commision to sell protein powder. If you really need, get one. Also don't buy the brand suggested by gym trainer. To get high commission they suggest you any other brand and they don't care about your health. They just care about their commision.Thanks for reading. Cheers!",61
Mahak Jain,Excellent...!!,5,25-Oct-18,Oh my god....its the most delicious flavor you can ever get in protein powder...it tastes exactly like rich coffee..add some ice cubes to it when you make it with milk...it will taste exactly like rich smooth cold coffee..whenever i drink this protein powder i feel like i want more....or you can have it just plain with water....both tastes equally good....If you are really a coffee lover go for it...!!!!Best..best...!!!,77

akshay kumar,Genuine product,5,30-Dec-17,"Brought this product through the seller cloudtail. I checked through few ways and found it to be a genuine product.How to identify:1. Check if there is a hologram (golden colour) at the cap2. Look for the manufacturing details and batch code at the bottom of the bottle . It should be in blue colour . The manufacturing date should be of a difference of 2 years exactly .3. Check for any spelling mistakes4. Scan the QR code and make sure it leads to their original site .5. Inside the bottle , there will be a scoop and it should be in golden colour with the ON logo .6. The powder should be very light like a talcum powder .Hope this gives you a better idea to check whether it?? genuine .Thank you cloudtail for delivering it in one day and I hope this whey protein gives me a good result .",673
sandeep,Genuine product,4,6-Oct-18,"I bought it from cloudtail india and its a genuine product. I have used it twice and it is good for fulfilling the protein content required by your body. I will recommend to those who are doing workout, gyming or exercises and require high protein content for muscle building. If you can complete your required protein content by food like eggs, chicken breasts, etc then there is no need of this protein powder. Therefore don?? buy it blindly, firstly do analyse your body protein needs, workout goals and daily protein intake you are getting currently then go for it. No issues with the product and the brand as it is 100% genuine of Optimum Nutrition.",13
Anurag,Good Quality Whey Protein,5,25-Jul-22,I purchased this product multiple times. Tast is ok for me. I check the authenticity code and packing after doing all the outer inspection its time to check the inside stuff. As we all know pure protein is not heat soluble so I would take some water in a cup put 1 to 2 teaspoon of the whey protein powder mix it and put it in the microwave for 2 mins. After two mins you will find the powder has turned into solid in indian language it will be like (fata hua dudh). We are set and ready to use the product tension free and focus on working out and putting extra effort.,2
Antra Maurya,Changes in Authenticity check,4,10-Jan-22,So I watched a lot of YouTube videos regarding ON authenticity.My product did not have an importer tag also there was no blue expiry date on the bottom.So I called ON customer support and the agent mentioned below points-1. Glanbia (importer) now imports raw material from US and packaging is done in India. I guess the plant is in Himachal and established some 6 months back.2. There will be no importer tag in new ON boxes.3. Expiry date and batch number is now printed on back of the box in a white space with black ink and not on the bottom.4.No vaccum cover on the lid intead a pasted seal.5. Check authenticity by the TRU SEAL (which we all do).,3
Christopher raj,5lbs front packaging new form,4,25-Sep-18,"When I scan the code the product is genuine and the taste is as same as the previous product it is good this is my second on standard and the result is good while following the good diet the reason why I gave 4 star is the package is comes from 5lbs form but the protein is 24g, BCAA's is 5.5g,glutamine and glutamic acid is 4g that's why and overall the product is great (good)",17
Ravish sharma,Beware!! Even cloudtail can't be trusted!!,1,8-Jan-22,"Please read this before purchasing!The scratch code written over the box was already tampered, so that you can't even authenticate the genuineness of this product.You can't return this product as well.Which means you have no other option but to regret.The scoop inside was also not the Golden coloured , but some transparent cheap one.",3

Amazon Customer,"May cause bloating, be aware",1,5-May-20,While it's rated to be a decent whey supplement but it may cause bloating especially for people who may not have a very strong digestive system which people usually don't. So be aware of that before buying this. Have bought it used it twice or thrice but now it's practically waste for me as I wont be consuming it considering it causes bloating every time,8

Amazon Customer,Good but only recommended for coffee drinkers,4,19-Nov-18,"So I ordered the mocha cappuccino flavour. The taste is 7/10 and the mixability is 9/10 since I use a shaker bottle. However this particular flavour contains actual coffee, so if you're not a regular coffee drinker and have low caffeine tolerance like me, you're gonna feel the effects of coffee when you drink this. For instance, when I had this in the evenings, I couldn't fall asleep at night. So if you're gonna go ahead and buy this, make sure you're ok with this or you're a  regular coffee drinker and have high tolerance.",8
Maneesh Saxena,"Clearing Old Stock, Absolutely Pathetic, Beware",1,28-Dec-20,"I am truly disappointed with the product. I received protien which was manufactured 1.5 years ago and will expire in next 7 months.Beware that it's not an exception, they will deliver old stock only. I discussed with Amazon representative on this, I requested him for replacement. He said that on site itself it was mentioned that protien will expire by May 2021. But it was not written that it would be 1.5 years older.  So no replacement.. :(So guys please be careful before you order it.",3
Atishay j.,Lack of a spoon. Fake product!!,1,14-Sep-20,The box I got was without the spoon. I doubt the products originality. I have never seen a product without a scoop nor never heard. I am using Whey Protein for the last 10 years and this is the first instance which I have encountered in my life. How to measure the quantity and consume it. I never a multinational brand like Amazon to deliver this type of product. It impacts the brand image of the company.,4
SHREDDER,Amazing product. Love it!!!,5,15-Oct-18,"Thanks Cloudtail & Amazon for giving this genuine product. It's very hard to buy orignal protein supplements online, as you will never know till you get it. This is fully authentic as it has a scratch code which can be validated on the link for authenticity. I have been using it for quite some time and the protein just works wonders. A must buy for anyone who needs a pure protein addition in diet. Great for increasing muscle mass and reducing fat if taken properly with regular exercise.",6
T?j?s,Bad Experience.,3,26-Dec-20,While placing the order the Best before date was shown as 5/11/2021. The delivered product had expiry date of 06/2021.

Kindly share right product details to Customers.,1
Akshay Patel,Not mixing well,1,9-Mar-22,"On the product, it says that Stir, shake, or blend until dissolved. But the product isn't dissolving at all. There are lumps left on the top which are not able to dissolve. Additional, there is some kind of layer of form after mixing with milk (mixing with water also has only a little layer of form and will taste like hell, will not be able to drink that). I don't know whether it is an original product or duplicate (yes, I checked on that website and it says Authentic Product but can't believe that).",1
Sushil,Not at PAR as I found out the same product bought from SHOP,1,4-Mar-20,"I use ON as usual Whey Protein for myselfusually I buy it from Shop or from my instructor straight from GYM,  this was my first time I bought it online and didn't like the taste at all, the inside lid was missing but it was sealed with transparent plastic from outside quite STRANGE!!!this isnt as effective as what i experienced usually...cant really comment on the sancity of the product but for sure something is wrong with the box I received and doesnt worth even 100 bucks whereas I have paid morethan 2.5 k on itfor me I wasted my money and lesson learnt not to go online when it comes to shop Whey Protein or supplements",3
George,"Scoop is different, not Golden .flavor rocky roads",2,14-Jul-21,"Product seems genuine. The only worry was the scoop is a transparent scoop with no logo on it. People who use Opitimum will be aware of the Golden scoop with Logo. I authenticated the product on Optimum website as well as had a call with the customer care- they told me due to environmental concerns the plastic  for the scoop is now transparent. Doesn't make sense at all? Taste wise is Ok.. flavours can be same as the actual rocky road, nor do other flavours except for the generic onces i.e vanilla, chocolate etc. Giving it 2 stars as of now, because of the scoop and the explanation given to me.",1
Amazon Customer,"Product was tampered, Pls take this seriously",1,30-Jul-22,Bottom of the container was tampered.

No chance with health at all.,1

Nitish Negi,A very well presented FAKE powder,1,19-Jul-18,"Well this is a very well done FAKE product.Now you guys must be wondering that how am I this sure about the quality of the product.So here it goes.I have been consuming this product from the last 1 year. And every time I have asked my known ones to get it from any GNC store in USA.So from the beginning I have consumed the genuine product.And now comes the interesting part. Why I am sure that this product is not Genuine.So the one I ordered from here was sweet like a chocolate powder that is used to make chocolate shake. The original GNC one I ordered was not sweet at all. It tasted all bland. Moreover the Sugar Content in the ingredients of the packing is 1gram per serving. Low enough that you just won't taste it. Just as in case of the GNC one.Also, when I first opened the jar, there were a hell lot of white particles all around the powder that were not mixed. I never saw anything like this in my previous protein of same make and type.Checkout the image I have attached.Another one was the powder seemed to be as if moisture has had its effect on it. The one I consumed from GNC was just like ""Maida"" with not moisture.Now at last, this is a very well presented fake product.Think I am just defaming it? Go ahead! Buy it.I don't care if you still want to have it.But would love to at least speak it out and help someone who isn't aware of such things.Peace!EDIT: Tried placing a replacement order just to see if I accidentally received the fake one. But to my surprise, it was 'MORE FAKE' than the previous one. This time, not only the powder but the whole packaging was copied and was fake. There was ""S"" missing in the ""ISOLATES"" in from on the box. Also, there was a difference in the design of the label.Have placed a return now.",12
Swapnil,Amazon Be ready for my next order in next month ;),5,9-Jan-18,"Thank you very much,Cloudtail for selling productAmazon for making it available and good customer support ""When I contact them for asking what if I get a fake product what will happen they said it's not eligible for return but if I received fake they will provide full support to me""But at the end I received genuine product: )Just I have one question (which I asked in question section so please answer it)Double chocolate taste like a little bit medicine like sweetner not like natural sweet sugar may be that's because there is artificial sugar in product: :) don't know 1st time buying it.I done following checks:-1.Container shape2.Dhakan shining :D3.spelling mistakesImportant: -4.Golden seal on neck5.Barcode on tub leading to Optimum nutrition site6.Barcode on ""bright commodities"" sticker leading to authentication process7.Scratching on ""Bright commodities"" sticker to get a code to put on official ""Bright commodities"" site for authentication8.Hole if someone try to remove original power and replace it with fakeFollowing things final things telling you quality of product: -9.Smell10.Mixing with water (yes if you kept it still particles at top will try to come together)And do mixing in glass mug so that you can see if particles are settling down (doesn't settle in case of original when check after 7-8 sec)11. Doesn't taste exactly like natural sugar sweet but something similar to sweetners.May be I put a lot of waterSo yeah thats all.Edit:- Ordered 2nd time :)This time I did a replacement because I was not satisfied with the quality of my first order and Amazon was really helpful in that.Amazon Be ready for my next order in next month.Edit:- Ordered 3rd time Double rich chocolate flavor is got dull I'll some new flavour next time may be Mocha Cappuccino :)Yeah and this time packaging was damaged  there was big whole in it but fortunately my product was safe.Amazon Be ready for my next order in next month.Edit:- Now this is my last edit,I tried Mocha cappuccino, Double rich chocolate, Extreme Milk Chocolate flavours and believe me, Mocha cappuccino is the only best flavour for me :). Now I'm gonna stick to Moch.Don't worry cloudtail selling genuine product :).",13

But guys this product is 100% original and I showed to my gym trainer also. It mixes well with water and you can bear it's taste as well.  In the product description they have mentioned few guidelines just to make sure the product is original. Make sure you see the expiry date as well. It was delivered on the expected date with a very good packaging. Totally loved it!",11
Shubhadeep Mukhopadhyay,TAKE TIME & READ THE WHOLE REVIEW THOROUGHLY. I hope you will find every tiny detail that you want/need in this review.,4,21-Mar-18,"I WILL GIVE THE FULL REVIEW POINT BY POINT (with attached Photos). ENJOY AND KEEP READING, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.Just to clarify and to be honest, this is the first time I'm using a Whey protein, not just the brand but Whey protein itself. Though, I was very skeptical about the purchase after reading so many reviews about the product being fake, I still decided to order it.ABOUT THE JAR/TUB (AUTHENTICITY CHECK from the outside): There was a strong chocolate smell on the outside of the jar already. I checked the bottom of the jar and the tub looked normal. Mfd and Exp date had exactly 2 years gap. I did not find any tampering marks whatsoever.There was the ""ON Authentic seal"" on the neck band. I checked everything thoroughly before opening it. The QR code on the jar itself led me to product page of Optimum Nutrition website.The QR code on the importer sticker led me to Bright Commodities authenticity checking page. I scratched the Importer sticker for the hidden code and entered all the details and it said that the product is authentic.After opening the jar, I did find the seal attached on the lid.The jar was kind of half filled, not up to the brim. (Doubt 1)I also found the golden scoop with the branding on it and Made in USA written inside the scoop along with some other details.SMELL, CONSISTENCY AND TEXTURE OF THE POWDER: The power smelled nice and the texture was normal I think (First time user), not clumpy or anything.No stickiness at all, the powder did not stick to the inside of the jar. (Authenticity checking method found somewhere online)One thing that I noticed was that, the powder had some white particles in it. (Doubt 2)Now, to clear out my doubts I called 011-49594959 which was Glanbia Performance Nutrition. I followed the instructions given by the IVR and asked about my doubts. The customer executive was helpful enough and told that ""The product is 100% authentic. The jar is supposed to be filled half way and the white particles are 'Amino Acids'.""I was satisfied with all the authenticity checking and all.TASTE: Though it smelled really chocolaty, the taste was just okay. According to me, it had a medicinal taste to it.Consistency was okay, not thick at all, it might just be the amount of water I added. (1 full scoop in one glass of water)MIXABILITY: It mixed with the water fairly easily. Found 1 tiny lump, and by ""tiny"" I really mean tiny, most of the people won't even notice it probably. I noticed it because I was trying to find lumps intentionally. Now, keep in mind that I did not use a shaker, it was simply stirred with a spoon in a glass. I did not even stir vigorously. So, mixability is good I think.RATING: Now, talking about the rating, I gave it a 4* just because the taste was okay.",14
Amrut,FULL REVIEW,5,9-Oct-17,"First of all would like to appreciate amazon for the fast delivery, cuz I got the product in 1 day of ordering.I was worried after seeing the reviews that my whey could turn out to be fake and I will regret buying from Amazon but it turned out to be genuine and although the Amazon seller was Cloudtailindia the product is indeed imported by Bright commodities which is the official importer of ON in india. To check the authenticity of the whey always watch videos on YouTube regarding ""how to identify fake ON whey from original one's"" before buying so that you can check it quickly once it arrives.Make sure on the day of the delivery you install a QR and barcode scanner app on your smartphone to quickly scan the codes on the tub which will take you to the official ON Website. As of the whey itself I'm completely relieved because it genuine and it's a trusted and no. 1 brand through the decade.i'd ordered double rich choc.My review on the product :1)TASTE - 8/102)MIXABILITY - 9/10 (always mix w/ cold water/milk)3)QUALITY - 10/104) EFFICIENCY* - 9/10..*efficiency could relate from person to person since it's based on many factors such as age, workout intensity,diet, dedication etc.dont expect to build a muscular body without working out hardcore in the gym and maintaining a healthy diet of egg whites,chicken,veggies and protein shake(remember it's a supplement not a whole food)THANK YOU.if any doubts feel free to dm me on Insta - amrut_p49",12

Amazon Customer,Fake Product,1,10-Oct-17,"Usually I order via health cart and products were good. The current product taste bad, does not mix well and no way a original product.

Rajiv Pillai,Great to taste with a promising nutrition,4,14-May-14,"For a first timer, I must admit that the taste of Double Chocolate is definitely good. It's too early and too little to comment about the health benefits but hopefully it should be great as well. The only drawback as compared to Nutrilite Protein Powder, is that this isn't a family protein powder. You can't give it to children below 18 who need protein equally well.",1
PS,Simply awesum number 1 product always,5,25-Jan-16,"One of the finest whey protein supplement we have in the market is this one, i am using it from past 4-5 months and i must say that i saw a huge difference in my muscle gain ability, yeah it also depends what diet you are taking , but this supplement is best even bodybuilding.com also announced it number 1 product, so without even thinking just go for it you will start feel the difference in muscle gain within one month.",1

Also, the product photo seems to be a fake one.But Amazon nailed it.The product was authentic, packaged well, and importantly, u can figure the genuineness from importer, bar code, batch number sticked on the product.And lastly, this product works for muscle building.To support my saying, please find the photos as described.Thanks amazon for early delivery and authentic product.",4

RS.VIJAYAVASANTH,Product Verification,5,10-Feb-17,To verify the authenticity of the product call 011-49594959. This is the customer care number for ON India.You would have to provide your details and the they will do the verification.,21
joseph,Good stuff,5,16-Feb-15,"Damn good stuff. But I found the lack of a seal over the mouth of the container(under the cap) to be funny, my initial thought was that the stuff was fake.  But it's the real deal.Shipping was good too, got it in 3 days.",1
Amazon Customer,It seems to be a FAKE product,1,3-Dec-16,"If you visit Optimum Nutrition official website to check the genuineness of their product, there are several tests that they recommend. And the product which I received didn't passed those tests.1. There is absolutely no seal, which is completely is contrast to what the website said. Product is readily available to rotate the cap anticlockwise and use. It's just like every other home container.2. The hologram is sticker on above the cap. Not in proper place.3. Container's bottom is not matching the description that's stated on official website.I've performed these tests only on packaging and container and it looks fake that way. However, I haven't used any sort of protein before so I'm clueless how to test the actual product.N.B.: I'm only doubting the genuineness of this product by looking at the packaging because it doesn't match the one described on the official website. However if that's how its supposed to be, than its also possible that it may be a genuine product.",3
JYOTHISH C V,ORGINAL PRODUCT,5,7-Jan-18,"I have been using whey protien of different companies for years including that of Optimum Nutrition,bought ON whey protien from amazon for last six months and almost certain about its genuinty as it ia as same as i used to take in Dubai.  Mixtureblity/texture wise ON protien is way ahead of other brands.  Friends about effectiveness it will take time to show of as unlike creatine and pre-workout amplifiers there is no immediate noticeable effect.  I strongly believe whey protien supplementation must be used in place of an unhealthy meal,which would be very important for an individual seeking an improved physique, whey protien and oats is an excellent unhealthy meal replacement for we indians.  Iam unable to find any negatives associated with optimum nutrition whey protien powder.  If you still have any doubt about your protien powder(authentic) pls call 011-49594959,they will easily solve the issue.",2

I have recived a fully authentic product.some tips for how to check for authentication1. Neat golden hologram ON branded on black plastic wrap of the neck of the tub2.correct nutrition facts of specific flavor(note all flavor doesn't have same facts plz check the flavor nutrition facts on ON website)3.blue ink jet printing on bottom of the tub manufacturing dat,expiring date,batch no is written4.scan barcode it will redirect you to the ON OFFICIAL WEBSITE and scan bar code it will mention the details of product and origin of the country( if bar code not readable then some thing is not write with the product)5.A white foam covering underneath the cap and no inner seal6. A golden colour scoop with ON branding is inside of the tub7.check out for any spelling mistakes and font  size and compare your recived productMIXABILITY ISSUES: there is no such issue in authentic product just pour a glass of water with 1-2 scoop of ON whey and shake for 10-20 secs the protine will dissolve completely with no lumps or wat so everPRICE: I brought it for 2609 the price is fluctuating all the times so look outTASTE: double rich chocolate is the best in taste compared to other whey flavor and it's natural flavor",2

The mfg date and exp date was printed below the tub in blue ink and were exactly 2 years apart.",2
PP,Not sure about Authenticity of the product,1,9-Oct-17,"Bad packing, box damaged when I received it. The bar code has 2 stickers on top of each other,  so effectively there are 3 bar codes, one printed on the box and other 2 stuck on the original one. I tried reading the top most but the bar code was NOT FOUND. Then I peeled off the top most bar code and tested the one printed on the bottle and it took me to the ON website. I don't understand why they have 3 bar codes and only one was read by the machine.The whey pounder has some white color material in it.The packing and the seal was not proper and it is safe to say that I was damaged.Not sure if Amazon is selling original ON products. The lid of the bottle opened without removing the seal. Funny!And even some whey pounder came out, though it was very little, it means that may not have been vacuum packed which suggests tampering.Not happy.",2

When I opened the lid, there was no seal pack at the top of the jar. Usualy even indian brands have the sealed air tight bottle opening.2. The moment I opened the Jar, a gush of stink entered  my nose. Although it lasted only Few seconds, but there it was.3. It does not dissplve easily. Even after shaking few times, few chunks of the protein remain undissolved.I never faced any of these problems in any of the indian brands. So I'm very very much disappointed. Even after paying so much if we can't get excellent quality, then what's the point of spending so much money on the brand.",1

And it actually opened without removing the seal so I was obviously tensed. Then I thought lets it give a try may be its not fake.

Just scan this code and enter the details along with your serial number, this will show you whether your product is genuine or not.3.

Smita S.,Doubt it?? a fake that I got.,1,28-Jun-18,I have used the same brand but sourced from the US before. This time I ordered it here. When I opened this pack I still had some from the US batch. There was a considerable difference in the texture of both the powders. The US one was smooth and this was one was course. This isn?? a guess work. I had both in front of me. The taste too was a bit different. I am not able to point out exactly how. Now I had been taking This for last three days and soon after consuming it I start feeling gaseous and rumbling in the stomach. Since yesterday I have developed loose motion. Haven?? changed my diet any other way. So a bit worried about the authenticity of the product. I have been taking whey protein for more than 6 months now. Never have I had a trouble before this.,2

Please don't buy.,1,22-Oct-17,It's really pathetic to see fake products selling like real at sites like Amazon.If you are a newbie please don't buy this from Amazon as the product is fake.How I identified it -1 - There was no golden spoon with ON logo inside.2 - The bottom of tub line was not similar. It is not flat. It is generally curved in.3 - The number of servings depend on tub size and flavor i.e. For the 5lbs the number of servings should be 74. Not 24.You can check this on their official website for the number of servings if you don't want to believe me.I wasted my 3 thousand on this. Please don't waste yours. Try healthkart instead. The product will be costlier but at least it won't be fake.,27

Raminder Pal Singh,Real or Fake !!!!!!!,1,25-Nov-17,I think the whey box is tempered. It's base is not in same style as available in USA.

I got the product WITHOUT the Gold colour scoop itself (with "Made in USA" written on it) in the box!,14

Atul Kumar Singh,Please read this before/after you buy - to authenticate your product,5,11-Mar-19,"If you??e planning to purchase this product, I request you to please read this review and key pointers for gauging product authenticity. I?? writing this review as many of other reviews are passing off even genuine products as fake owing to limited/wrong information.Before I go further, let me tell you that Optimum Nutrition (ON) Whey Protein is one of the best and most trusted products in the market and is used extensively by people hitting the gym. Hence, you don?? need to doubt the product itself, since it has proven its worth over time.When you first receive the product, Please make sure to take pictures of the box from all sides. Take zoom in picture of the Expiry Date / Batch Number. The simplest way to check for authenticity of the product is to mail the pictures to Optimum Nutrition Customer Care [Please visit the official site for contact details] on their USA customer care as well as India specific customer care (both available on official website). They work from 9AM to 5PM USA time, Monday to Friday, so don?? expect a response outside of this time. Also, please reduce the size of each image or else the server will reject the message due to large size. My first message with an attachment of 18MB was rejected by the server and I had to send it again. You need to mention below details while messaging the customer care -- Product Name- Size- Flavour- Name of the place of purchase and location (address or URL)- Country where you purchased- Seller Name or Item identification number (if purchased from an online marketplace)- Lot Number- Expiration Date- Last 5 Digits of Bar Code- Pictures of Batch Number / Exp Date / Mfd Date- Pictures of Front and back of the canister / Importer Label / Bar Codes / Invoice CopyCustomer Care should revert within 1-2 business days with details on whether product is authentic or not. In my case, they reverted within 2 days.The second step is to check for product authenticity through Bright Commodities site (if your product has been imported by Bright Commodities). Please check the box, there would be a label with importer details, a QR Code and a Scratch box on top. Scratch this box to reveal your unique product code. Now use a QR Code scanner through a smartphone, and you would land on bright commodities site, and you need to fill out a small form, and submit this unique code. On Submit, it will tell you if the product is genuine or not. In case of genuine products, it??l show: ??ongratulations. Your product is genuine.??This is sure shot way to verify if your product is genuine or not.Now, coming to ON certified methods of checking product authenticity. ON website mentions just 4 things to check if the product is authentic or not:1. NECK BAND ??Gold Standard whey protein has a black plastic neckband and a gold hologram seal. This seal is part of the neckband itself and is NOT a separate sticker. On tilting, you would see colorful ??N??written within the seal.2. TUB DESIGN - The crease on the bottom of U.S. made tubs of protein is a mold mark from plastic thermoforming. It looks the same on every tub and is normal. However, please note, Tubs produced in the U.K. have a circular indentation without a line running across the bottom. This is normal for European made tubs.3. DATE & BATCH CODE - On the BOTTOM or SIDE of protein tubs you??l find ink jet printing listing a manufacture date, expiration date and batch code. Powdered products have a 2-year shelf life, so the dates should be 2 years apart. This date is printed usually in Blue (mostly) or yellow color. Also, if you rub over it too much, it??l be removed.4. VACUUM BARRIERS - Under the cap of protein tubs is a cardboard vacuum barrier that helps hold the powder in place during shipping. This round disk is not for sanitation and is not glued into place. It is common for the cardboard to stick under the cap. So, using a knife or any sharp thin thing, you can remove this white colored cap. Underneath (on the plastic cover of the box), you will see ??ade in USA??if the product is manufactured in the USA.Some other pointers to safeguard against duplicate product -1. Powder Texture ??Gold Standard whey protein powder texture is such that it doesn?? stick to the insides of the box. When you open the box, powder should not be sticking to the side walls of the box. [See attached pictures of how it should look]2. Mixing - Gold Standard whey protein powder readily mixes with water without forming any lumps. If your product is forming lumps even after a lot of mixing and shaking, it is a fake product.3. Powder Scoop ??Every box comes with one scoop inside, which would have ON branding and would be of Golden color. Even the scoop mentions ??ade in USA??[Please check attached pictures]4. Black Neck Band would be glossy/shiny in textureBUSTING SOME MYTHS & WRONG INFORMATION. Below points DO NOT make your product fake.1. The black band does not have ??reat taste, new improved etc??printed all over like shown on the official website?? product authentication page.ON website doesn?? mention anything about printed neck bands, it simply mentions black plastic neckband. Even on ON official website, on the product page, it shows the box with a simple black band. Even biggest USA retailer websites, they would show product with a simple black band. Hence, please don?? get misguided by some other reviews where they proclaimed a product to be fake based on this point. My product has been verified as 100% authentic by the company, you can see the pictures.2. Box mentions ??SOLATE??instead of ??SOLATES??Across ON official website, you would see products with ??solate??mentioned (See various sections like 10lb product image, recipe images etc). Top US retailers show the same imagery with ??solate??mentioned instead of ??solates?? My product was verified as authentic by the company, it mentions ??solate??3. There is no QR Code on my box, and only importer QR code is shown.These products are manufactured especially for export for certain markets. For example, products imported by bright commodities are specially manufactured to be exported to India, hence you would even see ??SSAI??mentioned near the box bar code whereas FSSAI is an Indian standard. My product has been verified by the company itself, there?? no QR code as it?? for Export only, and you can see the pictures.4. Box shows green Veg symbol and there is no such concept in the US.These products are manufactured especially for export purpose and hence follow the standards of the destination country.5. Nutrition information is quite shorter and less informative, while on official web picture it is mentioned as ??utrition Facts??and more descriptive.No, this does not make your product fake. These products are manufactured especially for export for certain markets such as India. The company is following the standards as per Indian market and as per laws laid down by the Indian government, regarding ??utrition Information?? Pick any consumable product being sold in India, as per rule, ??utrition Information??needs to be mentioned as opposed to the USA, where ??utrition Facts??terminology is being used. This is the same reason why on these products, weight is mentioned in ??/Kg??before being mentioned in ??bs??6. My box is not completely filled with protein powder.Whey protein is sold by weight not volume, and the box is usually larger than the contents it is supposed to hold. It will roughly cover 65-75% volume of the box and would never be completely filled.That?? all friends. I hope now you would be in a better state to confirm if your product is genuine or fake. I hope I was able to help you out. When I was buying this product for the first time, I was equally confused. However, with above-mentioned points you can safeguard yourself against duplicate products. Thanks a lot.",12

This doesnt get dissolved completely and settles in the bottom even after shaking multiple times. Even tastes very different like some atta and sugar.

Amazon Customer,The Product is Authentic: Verified the barcode.,5,13-Jun-17,"First off, the product was delivered on time, the delivery person was very polite and pleasant which was nice.The product is genuine, the first thing i did was scan the barcode and was happy to see that it was authentic. Secondly, something that everyone has qualms and questions about, is taste. How does this thing taste? The answer: It tastes good, basically like chocolate milk to put it in simple terms. This isn't a milkshake, so if your drooling over the fact that its ""double chocolate ooo lala slurp slurp"", go get yourself one, this is a protein supplement, the key purpose of which is not to taste good. No it is not chalky, no it has no chemical taste or artificial taste.I did extensive research on the product before getting it, it is one of the safest and most genuine protein supplements out there, except that, yes, it does contain artificial sweetener, which is one con, perhaps a big one for some of you, but other than that i have read excellent reviews on the product. One thing that i can say is, ON whey alone will not get your muscles growing like they're on steroids. A lot of whackos on here complaining about how the product isn't genuine because they aren't seeing results. I'll give it to you plain and simple. Your diet plays a much much bigger role in your muscle growth and definition and overall performance, not the supplement. The supplement does 10% of the work, 20% of the work is you working out hard, the rest which is 70% is a good balanced diet, good sleep, and overall good lifestyle. SO if you expect Whey ON to make your biceps pop like popeye, and whine if it doesn't, your probably too immature to be taking protein.",10

Vaibhav Marathe,The best whey protein since 11 years,5,30-Nov-17,"On Gold Standard 100% Whey protein is continuously winning awards from 11 years as the best isolate whey protein and i'm using it from 2 years the best ever whey protein with the best results you get. Well talking about the flavour that it has More than 18 different flavours than any other whey protein manufacturer has.For better results take it immediately after your workout and try to take minimum 2 to 3 scoops daily as i take 1 scoop one hour later in morning after breakfast mixed with yoghurt and 1.5 scoop after workout in evening but keep in mind don't eat for 1 hour after consuming it let it get digested and then take your meals otherwise you are wasting your whey protein.Tips to find the product is genuine or not1. Lot Number : Every optimum nutrition product has a lot number which signifies that it belongs to the original ON product batch. This number can be found on the bottom of the jar.2. MFG and Expiry Date : Always check manufacturing date and expiry date. An expired product is of no use because it can give you serious side effects.3. Product Label : ON Gold Standard 100% Whey?? product label is printed with dark and vibrant colors with a shiny and smooth finish. You should check the label thoroughly, it should not look flimsy. It also lists 24g WPI, 5.5g BCAAs and 4g Glutamine. You should check that this info is correct on your label.4. Grammatical Errors : There is no room for grammatical errors on Optimum Nutrition?? product label. If you find any errors on the product label then it is fake.5. Check Seal : The container should be sealed properly from outside especially the lid is properly sealed if ON Gold 100 Whey is genuine. The seal is shiny and also the lead. Do not accept if there is no seal.6. Check Manufacturer?? Address : All ON products are mostly manufactured in the USA, so your Whey protein container should have the USA manufactures address. Check the back of the container.7. Scan The Bar Code : On the jar you will find a QR code and a bar code. Just scan these codes with your smartphone by using a QR code scanning app. It will show you product details. If the details come to be about ON Gold Standard 100% Whey then its genuine otherwise fake.#Flavours are rated above.??Extereme milk chocolate 10/10??Double rich chocolate. 9/10??Chocolate mint 8/10??Vanila ice cream. 8/10??Rocky road. 7/10??Mocha cappuccino. 10/10???Birthday cake. 7/10??Although my favourite is mocha cappuccino and extreme milk chocolate but mostly i take mocha cappuccino Because it taste little bit like coffee and i take it in cold low fat milk that's why it taste like cold coffee.So guys i think you will find this helpful.??This time the packaging was worse the jar was damaged but it is genuine. But This does not happen all the time. ??",2

Joshua S.,HONEST TRUE REVIEW!!!,5,7-Oct-19,"Whey protein isolate is the best form of protein to be directly absorbed into your body in the form of a liquid.Optimum nutrition gold standard hands on is the best supplement company available in the market, whatever the price may be, it assures and delivers quality protein supplements.For beginners take it slow and don?? rush to 1 scoop directly, have like a quarter a day, then after a few days go for half a scoop because your body needs to adjust to these supplements as you may get loose motions and runny stools if not consumed properly.Some of the cases are1) if you??e new and completely take 1 scoop and your body doesn?? adjust to it.2) if you consume whey on an empty stomach early morning without anything to eat and if you??e really hungry3) directly consumed whey and you go to sleepSo the best time is after your workout drink it with chilled milk as milk gives you added proteins.But remember whey is a supplement like any other who doesn?? have time to prepare 1 major meal and needs a substitute for that.Whey proteins are a fast absorbing substance and hence to process it is expensive as it has to go through numerous processes( can?? explain it in detail), hence the finished product is also expensive, but it delivers results.This cookie and cream flavour is really good I?? rate it a 4/5The absorbency I?? rate it a 3.8/5And it?? truly a genuine product.Suggestion, have a couple of bananas, oats, boiled chicken breast, peanut butter for better results.",1

Amazon_Shopper,Best whey protein on earth. Tips to find out the fake ones.,5,25-Mar-17,"First of all I didn't buy this whey protein from Amazon. I bought it from authorized neulife store. Double Rich Chocolate is the best flavor of ON 100% Whey and has a mouth watering taste even with water. Milk gives more rich taste and you will feel that you just have eaten a double chocolate drink. Its taste is awesome.Now I am here to tell you guys about spotting the fake ON Whey protein and also I will address some misconceptions about this product which are unnecessarily degrading its value.Tips to check the genuine ON Whey1. First of all if you are worried about the genuinity then I would suggest you buy ON protein only from three sources. These three sources are neulife online store (neulife online store), neulife retail store, and finally Cloudtail India on Amazon. There is no doubt that neulife is the oldest importer of ON products in India so you can buy from them with confidence. I contacted Glanbia India customer care and they have confirmed this that neulife directly imports ON products from Glanbia and they also said that Cloudtail India is also their trusted ON whey seller. If you are buying from Cloudtail and getting ON Whey with a 'Bright commodities' sticker then it's all genuine.2. Neulife has a better system of verifying their ON Whey products. Every neulife ON Whey product has a unique code, QR code that you have to scan or SMS to neulife to verify it. I instantly got a message that ""My ON whey is genuine"". You can only verify it once though.3. The double rich chocolate flavor is awesome and when you mix it with water it forms a white creamy layer and taste if awesome exactly like double rich chocolate.4. If you are mixing one scoop with little water then it will the real chocolate taste with very very little bitterness exactly like a dark chocolate. It is sweet also. The bitterness is sometimes unnoticeable, this bitterness feels exactly the same on tongue after eating a dark chocolate.5. DRC flavor smells like chocolate and have tiny white in it.6. Comes with golden seal which is printed on the black label.Misconceptions:Some people say that they are getting fake supplements and half of the powder is fake. Some also say that the sellers cut the container from the bottom and remove the original powder and fill it with some fake powder. But I checked my container from inside after emptying it and found that the bottom is intact from inside and no sign of cutting the container was found. Please check attached images for clarification.But if you buy from neulife then there is no problem. Cloudtail India sells genuine ON whey as confirmed by Glanbia Performance Nutrition, but I can't say about the delivery agents. Buying supplements online are also not good in summers as these supplements need cool places to store while during transit the whey powder go though heat which may degrade its quality.If you are going to GYM then stay away from trainer's advice over this and never buy even if he gives you heavy discounts. This gym trainers will never give you the protein imported legally, they will either sell you grey market stuff which is mostly fake or they sell you supplements that are imported from unknown sources. Stay away from these fake trainers if you love your body.I was shocked to know that my GYM trainer doesn't know about neulife.So buy your protein from neulife or cloudtail only. Also stay away from low quality supplements like MuscleBlaze, don't get fooled in the name of made in India whey protein. ON is the best whey protein in the world. It is light on stomach and won't give you headaches or stomach pain. It is digested easily and helps in muscle building.Attached images for more info.",28
Abbas Shirazi,The caffeine content per scoop is very proportional to the protein per scoop we get.,4,7-Oct-19,"Firstly, i would rate this particular product 9/10 as compared to other whey proteins of ON.This mocha cappuccino tastes fantastic, I liked it a lot.

Ashish Prasad .com,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard - One of the Best Whey Protein Blends,5,7-Mar-16,"--------------------------------------UPDATE 11 March 2016---------------------------------------I keep an eye on my reviews but lately, I have seen this happening often . I get a few votes up for a review  and then quite strangely  a down vote the same day, that really has left me wondering if some people are deliberately down voting reviews. I don't understand how Amazon moderators are letting this off.---------------------------------------------I am compelled to write this review after seeing quite a few negative reviews calling it a fake or counterfeit which I find it quite misleading once again. I bought the 1lb pack to check the concerns raised that the packaging is mislabeled with a 23gram protein scoop. To all the concerned people, there is in fact 1lb Gold Standard refill pack with 24g protein per scoop. (Photos attached)
Optimum Nutrition (ON) 100% Whey Gold Standard - 2 lbs (Double Rich Chocolate)
?is one of the best Whey proteins in the market today. Three things I liked about this product, the manufacturing is entirely done in the USA following strict US regulations, the grams of protein in each scoop and the taste.If you??e new to Protein Supplements, this is a quick overview of few major protein types that are sold in the market today.Most protein supplements that are in the market offer blends of different types of whey proteins. To make it easy, let me break it down for you. There are three types of fast digestive proteins, the cheapest is the Whey Concentrate typically a mass gainer with lots of carbs , then comes the more expensive Whey Isolate and then the most expensive Whey Hydro Isolate .Concentrate typically takes about 2-3 hours to digest, Isolates can be digested in your system within 2 hours, Hydro Isolates is purest form whey and can be taken even if you??e lactose intolerant - Hydro isolates can be digested within an hour and work best as Post Workout drinks. Basically, the price of your protein directly depends on the % of Whey Isolate or Whey Hydro Isolate present. There is also a slow digestive protein called Casein which is cheaper or almost the same as Whey Concentrate, treat this as a bedtime supplement as it takes about 6 hours to digest.What is OPTIMUM NUTRITION- 100% Whey Gold Standard ?ON 100% Whey Gold Standard is a multi-whey blend comprising isolates & concentrates as its main ingredients. It contains 24 grams of protein per serving, with a bit of fat, cholesterol, and lactose. Bear in mind, if you??e lactose intolerant, this is not for you unfortunately.Taste, Texture and MixabilityIt is not very sweet and mixes well with water and milk. I didn?? feel bloated and Double Chocolate flavour I??e tried was good, and I will give8.5/10 for the taste9.5/10 for mixabilityTotal score 9/10When will I start seeing results?This is the bitter truth, Protein supplements would help you <20% to reach your fitness goals. Your everyday workout helps you about another 30% and the rest is your daily diet as to how you maintain yourself eating healthy. You??e not going to get fitter staying home and just having 3 protein smoothies a day.From somewhere I had once read, you don?? buy protein protein supplements till you are regular at the gym working out and eating healthy for at least 90 days. Once those two habits are accomplished, buy protein supplements, and you will see results.Are protein supplements necessary?This question is debatable but it all comes down to how much protein is in your everyday diet. If you??e enough protein in your diet, no need obviously. From a personal perspective, I would avoid processed food like protein supplements any day, if I can consume enough protein through my diet (egg, milk, meat etc)Health Benefits/ IssuesIt is always advisable to take protein in their natural form (Milk, Egg, Meat, etc), but with a vegetarian diet that could be challenging. Rule of thumb with supplements is DO NOT go overboard - DO NOT take more than 2 scoops in 24 hours, but personally, if you??e not aiming for the Olympics, I suggest to start with 1 scoop a day so that you go easy on your body. In addition, you MUST drink a lot of water when taking protein supplements. From a lecture of Dr Tara Swart of MIT Sloan, your body requires 500ml of water for every 30lb (13.6 Kg) of your weight in a day to function normally.Smoothie recipe = 1 scoop (Chocolate) + 1 Avacado + Banana + 200ml Almond Milk + Ice Cubes in a Blender .PLEASE NOTE: Insufficient water intake can give you Stomach pain/ Abdominal Pain with protein supplements. NOT to be considered professional/medical advice. This review is based on personal experience. Protein supplements are to be considered with caution.",195

Prime Customer,Use common sense,2,17-Aug-17,"You dont need supplements to build muscle.Because for body weight of 76kg you need nearly 150g of protein.And whey protein gives 24g for 1scoop so if 2lb is around Rs.3000 each scoop costs Rs.100 and you are still at deficit of neatly 135g.Chicken is even better a kilo costs Rs 130 and boneless breasts costs Rs. 200 and 100gm of the same costs Rs 20 and gives 31g of protein and 1gm fat. So having twice gives you 61gm of protein and costs Rs. 40 and with milk, eggs & oats, roti/chapati & rajma/channa/chole gives you full protein daily requirement all totalling under Rs. 100.So it makes no sense to buy supplements. Its like this as if you drinking horlicks makes you taller stronger and sharper and you've been drinking it since your childhood and you know the results.I am not saying taking supplements wont build muscles it does actually. But it makes no difference if you take chicken or egg or whey protein or milk. Protein is protein.All that matters is meeting your daily protein requirement of nealy 1.5 or 2gm of protein / kg of body weight and incase you are deficit in your daily requirement of say 25g you supplement it with supplements hence the name supplements ie you complete your deficit gap by supplementing it with shakes.And it makes no sense to make it as primary protein food and drink 6 scoops to meet such requirement spend Rs.10000 a month when normal food costs under Rs. 1500 and meets all your requirement.People in US usually take 2 scoops not because whey protein builds more muscle but because a pound of chicken or ~450g costs 6-8 dollars which can make up for 2 or 3 servings or one to one and half days so for a month it costs them considering $7 as average it costs $210. So in US whey protein is cheaper but in india chicken is cheaper.Its all consumerism they want you to buy so that they can make money.WRT preworkout creatine it makes no difference its just placebo effect. Ive used it for 2 years. Your strength grows naturally over time with or without creatine just eat proper normal food. And there is no better pre workout than a banana/rice",11
