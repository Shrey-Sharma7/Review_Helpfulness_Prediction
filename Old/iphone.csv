"Abhishek","4.0 out of 5 stars","An overall good premium experience","SUMMERY: As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn't any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.
PROS:
1. Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!
2. The screen is AMAZING.. it doesn't have 90 or 120 hz refresh rate but it FEELS better than my Nord with 90 hz!!
3. A14 bionic promises years of performance ahead.
4. Battery life is somewhere in between good & great.
5.
6. The dimensions of phone, it's smaller than usual android phones and feels much more handy along with less weight.
7. Overall build quality is great.
8. Best audio output out there.
9. Long term support.
CONS:
1. SLOW CHARGING. 20 W only, you'll be jealous of 1/3rd price phones with 60 W charging. Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery's health.
2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there's still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many ""commonsense"" things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????
3. DON'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.
4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that's missing.
5. Ridiculously expensive accessories
6. Battery life is above good but not great.
In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it's expensive. Do know that you're NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty.","122 people found this helpful"
"Prasanna Bhalerao","4.0 out of 5 stars","iPhone is the standard against which all smartphones are compared","I purchased this phone for my wife. Last year I purchased iPhone X for my son who is currently in the UK. I own an iPad and iMac 27"". I am not going to buy an iPhone for myself - at least not yet. One of the main things that I don't like about Android phones is the crap (bloatware) that each maker puts in. Moto and Google Pixel come with pure stock Android. So those can be left out. So I wanted a good phone for my wife so that she could FaceTime with my son in the UK anytime.
What is there to say? So many have written about it. Since everyone writes all the positives, I will write some negatives. While there aren't too many, no product can be perfect:
1. Brings in all the junk from the old phone. If one is switching from Android to iPhone, the ""Move to iOS"" app on Android can help. However be sure to clean up your Android phone first else all junk (especially ""Good Morning"", ""Good day"" picture crap from WhatsApp photos). Be sure to clean the SMS inbox also, especially all those blocked and spam messages which may be hidden from the main view and we never know that exist.
2. WhatsApp cannot be synced. Yes, there are 3rd party apps but they are full of ad-crap and I can't trust them for security.
3. Difficulty in validating iMessage and FaceTime. I could not activate iMessage and FaceTime with my mobile number. I simply could not figure this out. This is the case with my Vodaphone SIM/Number in India. Only when I added my email to my Apple ID, the two apps started working. Even now, the mobile number is not verified.
4. I wish Apple provides dual SIM. Now dual SIM is almost a necessity. But as my wife does not use two SIMs, for her, it is fine.
5. Apple is providing USB-C to lightning cable. They should supply USB-A to lightning cable instead. 99% of the chargers have a USB-A output. I had to purchase a USB-A to USB-C mini adapter (‚Çπ180) for this, or someone may have to buy a cable of the type (good cables from Apple, Belkin, Anker cost ‚Çπ1100 and above). By far, this is my biggest grouse.
6. This is not the latest iPhone. The iPhone 13 was ‚Çπ73,000 and did not seem VFM. Even at ‚Çπ56,000 (‚Çπ55,900 to be exact), the iPhone12 may not be money best spent. This is one reason, why I haven't purchased an iPhone for myself all this while (I can afford to buy the latest one every year).","74 people found this helpful"

"Navaneeth","3.0 out of 5 stars","Somehow Returned this","I got this product on 20th April 2022 and returned it on 28th April 2022 haha, with so much excitement I opened the product and started using it, since I was an Android to iOS user I did find some difficulties in using it but it was fine. The real problem started while using it,
The Phone started to overheat for minimal usages, I'd call for 5 to 10 minutes hands would be burning with phone heat, 15 minutes of social media again hands would be burning hot, I didn't get any temperature warning but heat was hot enuf for me to keep it aside for a long period of time, Due to overheat the battery used to die fast and I would hv required to charge it thrice a day. I roamed around the Apple authorized service centres and so many calls to Amazon for a replacement but nobody seems to give me any solution, then I thought I'll just use it, but again it started getting worse and I called Apple and they said to give my phone to service centre for 7 to 10 days so they can diagnosis be done and find out issue while I survive 7 to 10 days without a phone haha, then I couldn't take it anymore as I understood if I continue using this phone I wouldn't get 4 weeks yet alone 4 years and pleaded to Amazon coz I am a prime member ever since prime was out and I have ordered tons and tons of products in Amazon and never faced this issue.
But the hard earned money going like this was hurting so I submitted whatever documents Amazon asked me to get from Apple and finally they gave me return for this product.
The item has been returned and get to reach their warehouse which then oly I will get my refund initiated which is gonna take another 15 to 20 days, but I'm fine since I can wait and not lose my hard earned money. For now I hv a 7 year old phone as backup which is working ok ok but I can manage to write atleast this review.
So whoever face this issue, and wants a replacement or return please try your best with whatever Amazon asks from you n they will provide a solution.
I still need to buy an Apple phone next coz I bought the 2k adapter and it's return period got over haha.
Anyways the Phone was amazing to use,
So performance wise 5/5
Camera was just amazing 5/5
Battery tho 1 or 2/5
Over heating so -2/5 or 0/5
Overall a bad experience but still excited to get apple product.
Btw Apple service centres help very well and listen to ur problems and provide solutions properly and handles it well.
So if you are getting a iPhone I hope u guys don't face any situation like mine.
Thank you n have a great day :)","4 people found this helpful"
"Aashik Francis","5.0 out of 5 stars","Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.","I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I‚Äôve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive.
If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.
Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021), apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra. If you read a few reviews you‚Äôll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues and 9pro cameras didn‚Äôt live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.
Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:
1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)
2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag
3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality
4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand
5. The haptics are spot on
What‚Äôs Missing: (Minor misses though)
1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you‚Äôll get used to it.
2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change
3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensor
Wait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:
It took a while for 12‚Äôs prices to fall. If you‚Äôre willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.
64GB or 128GB:
The difference is around ‚Çπ6000. 64GB if you don‚Äôt play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128üòä
Battery:
I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to it‚Äôs competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.
Android Flagship Option:
The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.
Hope this review helped :)
Update:
13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That‚Äôs it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.
iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12‚Äôs launch price(86k). If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k). However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.
Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022.","97 people found this helpful"

"RakhuNathan","4.0 out of 5 stars","Not Really worth the money","I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.
Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)
Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items. But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?
Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.
I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.

CONS : Battery and Cost","220 people found this helpful"

"Asutosh padhy","4.0 out of 5 stars","Absolutely loved the phone but price could have been bit cheaper","I phone i must say having great optimization of software with hardware, more quality apps are available when compared to google, receiving a file is the only major pain i felt till now,
Battery backup is really good 2800 mAh in apple is almost like 5000mAh in android am not kidding, i have rog phone 3 it is 6000 mAh but at the end of the day the i phone has almost same % left, may be it's due to the less hz display.
Despite of having 60Hz display it feels good
And what can i say the speakers are loud and clear compared with rog 3.
45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it's not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.
No charger is a big let down by apple. And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.
No Finger print sensor , but it's ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good. And for the notch it's ok. I phone 12 and 13 has virtually no difference so y to waste 20k more money buying the 13 just for the bit improvement of camera and brightness, hope you like my review üôÇ","16 people found this helpful"

I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-
Memory
Build quality
Camera
Processor
Display
Except battery there‚Äôs rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,
iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here‚Äôs some condition that you should aware about
1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.
2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you‚Äôre on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.
Here‚Äôs some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know ‚ÄúHow to save battery on iPhone 12‚Äù this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.
For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don‚Äôt have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.

"Piyush Kumar","3.0 out of 5 stars","Phone is great but iOS sucks","First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.
Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.
It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-
iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.
let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-
1. Notifications
- You can't reply through notifications.
- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)
- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).
- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.
2. App library
- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.
3. whatsapp
- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.
- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.
- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)
- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.
The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.
I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.
I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing.","26 people found this helpful"

I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.
Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.
I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.
And boy was I surprised . Let‚Äôs take up the review in sections.
1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .
2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it‚Äôs only for social media and you are not printing really big.
3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it‚Äôs average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.
4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.
5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.
Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended.","74 people found this helpful"

Thankfully I have not received a brick but what if I have ? Who would have been responsible?
Who would have paid for my loss ?
If you are ordering expensive items , make sure to capture the video and ask delivery guy to open before submitting OTP..

"Chetan Pamini","5.0 out of 5 stars","99.99% Perfect Smartphone !!","Nicely packed !! Kudos to seller !!
I was very much confused between iphone 11 and this one as the price of iphone dropped ... But i am glad i chose this over iphone 11.
1.Display:
Main upgrade in iphone 12 is the oled display. Boy o boy the screen is amazing. I have user many android flagship's but this beats them all.
2.Battery:
Battery is amazing. I am getting 1.5 days of battery life with my usage.
PS: i dont play games.
3.IOS:
This is my 1st iphone and the experience with ios is great ... Very smooth animations ..even though its not 90hz screen but everything is buttery smooth.
4. Camera:
The pics from this phone is superb. FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA! You will not be dissapointed.
5 Build &Design :
This phone looks and feels very premium compared to other phones.Very comfotable to use.
6.Face Id:
Face id works very fast and accurate in low lighting conditions.
7.Updates:
Ios14 is good and we can expect another 4yrs of software updates thats huge !
Cons:
1.Priced very high but it may be because of high taxes and custom duty.
2.No charger and earpods in the box.
3.Notifications are a mess ...android is better in managing new notifications.
Overall a great Phone IF You are OK with the Price !!!","240 people found this helpful"

- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos.
- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.
- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume and gives awesome vibe while listening to music
- iOS has no bugs at all
- 20W charging is lit üî•

"Good vegetable","4.0 out of 5 stars","How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12","After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue
1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.
2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.
3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.
How to choose between 64/128gb:
If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.
CONS:
1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price
2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consuming

1) Limitations of common Charger. I have to use different charging cables for my iPhone, while my iPad Pro, Samsung Buds etc share a USB C cable.
2) Some advertised features require the support of additional devices of Apple Eco System. For example, Apple said with iOS 15.3 face ID will work even with Masks On. But I just learned that this feature works only if you have an iWatch also.
3) Not a gamer, but still for this price point at least a 90Hz refresh was desirable.
4) Front Camera, sometimes have not of noise (nitpicking)

"rupinder","3.0 out of 5 stars","I miss my OnePlus 6","Android v/s iOS
Pro Apple
1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.
And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud.
2. Battery
The battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.
3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.
4. Build Quality - SOLID.
5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.
6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.
Pro Android / Anti - iOS
1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.
2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.
3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.
4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.
5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.
6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.
7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.
I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now.","26 people found this helpful"

I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.
The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.
The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.
The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.
Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.
Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.","2 people found this helpful"

"Sanjib M.","4.0 out of 5 stars","READ before BUY ! ""Iphone 12! Worth buying or not?""","From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.
As per the limitations :
1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)
2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.
3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)
4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)
5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)
Advantages:
1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.
2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)
3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)
4. The design and in-hand feel.
5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.
Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)
On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.
But iPhone 12 in 2020? its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.
If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience.","46 people found this helpful"

This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.

Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.
The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.
So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily.","38 people found this helpful"

"Lav","4.0 out of 5 stars","Great purchase!","I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.
As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.
Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.
When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.
I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.
INR 3000‚Çπ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000‚Çπ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000‚Çπ. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900‚Çπ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.
Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure.","3 people found this helpful"

"...who else","4.0 out of 5 stars","Moving from Android to iOS?","Yes, it is a 5 star phone. But if you are moving from android to iPhone please be ready to lose your freedom. There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.
Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.
For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.
Rest, there are tons of reviews to praise the phone and I agree with most of them.

I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.
And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again. FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.
SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?
THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in android
and lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.
overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here","40 people found this helpful"

Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.
I‚Äôll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.
Pros:
1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.
2. The speed, the performance.
3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don‚Äôt usually need any professional touch.
4. Battery life - I‚Äôll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don‚Äôt play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don‚Äôt believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.
Cons

"Vignesh Bhasker","3.0 out of 5 stars","I prefer the 11 or the 12 mini","I have been an apple user for the past 10 years and this is the first phone which is disappointing. I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.
1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.
2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR
3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.
4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.
5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.
6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.
7. again no ear phones.
8. It somehow doesn't have the wow factor as what the X had.
Update.
I exchange my phone for a 12 mini. much more easier to use with one hand and comfortable.","9 people found this helpful"

"Aman Srivastava","5.0 out of 5 stars","Intelligence of future","I was an avid android user for past 25 years. This move to IPhone 12 was a calculative yet bolder definitive move.
Let‚Äôs look at the some of key pointers here what I saw -
- Stunning design and spectacular OLed display pouring out all the vivid colors
- Smooth app flow and transitions
- Longer battery life 7-8 hrs without automation (best in my usage)
- Camera is just bringing the life out of all the captures you make.
*I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It‚Äôs almost a month of usage and I can boldly say, ‚ÄúThe best switch one can make‚Äù. I know the price tag is always hefty but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.
*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.
*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving.","4 people found this helpful"

Pros:
1. The green colour is gorgeous
2. Cameras are outstanding
3. Battery life is really good, lasts me almost 2 days on a charge
4. Screen is very bright and has vibrant colours
5. Speaker is very loud
Cons:
1. Just nitpicking, but a fingerprint sensor would have been much more convenient during Covid
2. Indian variant doesn't have the mmWave antenna, inspite of being more expensive than the US Variant

I have more to add to my earlier review after roughly a month of use. The phone is an original Apple device. It's smooth and quick, and it doesn't become hot when in use or charging. The charge lasts the entire day (I use it mostly for social media, web browsing and music) Face recognition is excellent. Battery health is 100% (check this when you receive your phone under ‚Äòbattery health' in settings) and to keep it that way, make sure you close all background apps while the phone is not in use. Play a ‚Äòpixel test 4K' video on YouTube to see if your phone monitor has any dead pixels. I use the original Apple adaptor (which must be purchased separately) and the type C cable that comes in the box. Overall the phone is a great purchase!",""

Typing is a task, simply tapping on the character you want to edit isnt sufficient, you have to press it long enough to hand hold the cursor to the character you want to edit and then make the change
Notifications are a hassle, it keeps coming up
Either you can stop them completely or you keep them coming, there is no middle ground
Battery backup is average and also isnt properly optimised
No fingerprint reader coz apparently they think that face id is superior tech or something which is again slower as compared to android

The speakers are very loud and clear and give out high quality sound.
One problem I encountered is that the battery life is not great but definitely above average. Another issue is the notch which makes the phone look outdated especially in 2021. The Face ID is also not useful while wearing masks which causes a lot of inconvenience since the phone doesn‚Äôt have a fingerprint scanner. The phone is also limited to a 60Hz refresh rate which again makes it less compelling than the competition which makes phones with 120Hz refresh rate at a much lower price.","4 people found this helpful"

It has FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA. I need to charge it once for full day usage(not an heavy user) while using internet. OLED display is superb. Being an Android user since start, I was not able to restore my Whatsapp data in IOS which was one of the drawbacks. Overall it is good phone but overpriced. You won't get charger and earphones. There is a challenge to try new apps as most of the apps in IOS are paid with just 3-7 days trial period. There are other brands in market who provides similar features at very less cost but at the end it's IOS vs Android.","One person found this helpful"

Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone.

Cons:
There is no earphone jack, no nfc toggle idk which is waste of battery(its always on), No Apple pay in India(Samsung pay is there tho). No app locker or hider like in android. No fingerprint scanner. It has a notch. Notification bar can't customized to show battery percentage or network speed. No call recording feature. Airplay doesn't always work in non native apps. WiFi in beginning had trouble connecting sometimes.
Pros:
No bloatware
Great security, even installing a new app or system update requires face I'd or pin.
Good for special needs people they get lot of tools to help usage like voice control, which is others can use to coz its handy.
Silent physical switch left side of the iphone.
Imovie for making videos.

"Vineet","1.0 out of 5 stars","iPhone is like a Shadi ka Ladoo","I was an Android user and had high hopes with this Apple gadget, however after 8 months of using this so hyped Apple device, I can finally say that an iPhone is similar to a Shadi ka ladoo ‚Äî jo Khaaye wo pachtaaye aur jo na khaye wo bhi pachtaaye. The reason I am saying this is because this phone lacks even the most basic features that even a 5k android phone has, like - call recording - which I eventually realised that it should have been an Apple feature instead of third party apps - which demand money and are pretty inconvenient to use.
The second drawback is that call logs are auto erased and kept up to a certain stack size (100 / 102) and if you want to go back to pull any earlier call logs beyond this specified stack size, you won‚Äôt be able to do so and will have to rely on your network provider (if you are eligible) for the same.
These are two very ground level use cases that fail to deliver in an Apple device and since I faced real life situations surrounding these two scenarios I feel that I it is not worth having this Phone and better to keep your ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù pants on.
Then I thought why I bought this phone in the first place and got my answer -
1. Camera ??
Android phones are easily competing nicely with iPhone Camera now-a-days and some have even better camera.
2. Brand marketing / re-selling value / durability ??
I am so over it now after 8 months of usage and the price keeps on sinking down as newer model enters the market so not a wise call I must say
Final outcome:
Definitely not a returning customer.","6 people found this helpful"

Camera is very good and takes perfect picture especially the portrait mode which is actually superb.
Buttery smooth operating system and iOS 14.3 is superb. I actually do not feel the difference with 120 Hz refresh rate. The phone does not really lag at all, the dual SIM capability is also lovely and helpful.","2 people found this helpful"

ios- efficient and tidy.
5G; Jio gives 4G+ currently to 5G mobiles as of 27-Dec-2020.
The chassis feels different than rest phones in a good way.
OLED display feels good to view.
Usual iPhone perks- longer software support.
Dislikes:
Overpriced as usual, more so this time since not bundled with earphones and charger.
Apple charger doesn't come with a lightning cable. Please buy cable separately, if needed.
The selfie camera dulls the skin tone. Selfies taken via Androids look better.
Here's my 2 cents:
I'm using it as a secondary phone with OnePlus 8 as my primary.
Please use your discretion.

First some one told me to visit Apple store to collect job sheet or diagnostic report. So I visited Apple service centre collected the same and they confirmed that the product is faulty. There was hardware issue.
So after receiving that report when I tried to reach the customer service officer they denied the fact and said only Apple can do the replacement not Amazon. Then when I asked share one copy of that terms and conditions over mail they failed to do that as well. Not at all helpful behaviour and filled with wrong information.

"prajith kj","1.0 out of 5 stars","My worst mistake is to buy this product online","I am writing this, so nobody else end up in my situation. Bought a brand new iphone 12 from amazon for republic day sale. The product was defective , storage issues were there. System data itself was consuming 50 gb of total space so my phone was immediately full.
Called Amazon support as it was within replacement period, they asked for a service denial report from apple service centre. When I checked with the service centre they informed apple never shares a service denial letter . And by my logic it was reasonable as how can apple deny service for their own product under warranty. Anyways amazon was useless , no support provided stating some strange reasons (service denial letter) !!
Took this to apple service centre (iplanet vr mall bangalore) they kept my phone for 14 days doing nothing. They confirmed the phone is defective at the first place but was not able to support as it is a software glitch. They want me to escalate it through apple support only. Irony is I submitted it in service centre as per the suggestion by apple online support.
At the end I am in a clueless situation not getting to know what to do with this product after spending 62000 INR. I suggest NOBODY to buy any apple product from amazon even if it looks so tempting with discounts and sales. Please dont fall pray for this trap.","8 people found this helpful"

It‚Äôs a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple‚Äôs trickery and gimmickry.
The battery doesn‚Äôt last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won‚Äôt be enough for anyone.
And then there are other apple quirks - won‚Äôt come with a SD card, won‚Äôt come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won‚Äôt work with this one. Face ID won‚Äôt work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you‚Äôre out and vulnerable. This phone won‚Äôt allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn‚Äôt use. You won‚Äôt be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won‚Äôt let you.
Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn‚Äôt cost you more than 12 to 14K.
Apple is going down!
Amazon won‚Äôt take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy. So I am pretty much stuck with this damn excuse for a phone till I get to upgrade to a Samsung phone.","673 people found this helpful"

And upon contacting customer support I was informed by Ms. Tuleshwari from support team to connect with Brand and in case the brand is ready to issue a service report they will initiate the replacement request. Upon getting the service report done from Apple service centre the support team staff Mr. Sanjay on outright basis denied replacment stating we cant issue basis the report. It's the brand who will have to be contacted. Customer service and support is clearly lacking with a brand like Amazon. What's the point of claiming of a free 7 day replacement policy when the support team clearly twists it as per their own convenience.

I dare Amazon to give me the reasons for not exchanging it if they have one. So don't fall for the exchange pray, appears to be a ploy. My umpteen emails to Amazon customer service on this topic was unanswered and finally upon escalation, the Executive CS team wrote back stating that the reasons for exchange can't be shared as it's an internal communication of theirs. Quite absurd! I quote below the etracts of their email dated 25th Aug 2021... Quote: I've reviewed your concern and see that our customer service team was able to address your issue concerning your exchange being denied. We are unable to provide internal information about the reason for exchanges being denied. Unquote:
Now that's a complete surprise to a customer... If my phone doesn't gets exchanged, as customers I need to know the reasons too.. denial by Amazon to give a reason implies here that the exchange options are a gimmick to lure in customers to buy Phones on their online store.. Definitely, never expected Amazon to behave in this manner. Asides, Amazon CS took conveniently more than 2 weeks to respond to my emails and when they have responded the return window too is closed!!! Sad :(","10 people found this helpful"

But even after updating there was no improvement so called apple support spoke to then at length about my situation and after hearing me they did some troubleshooting and came to a conclusion that it has some hardware problem and should approach Amazon as they were responsible for selling me this product for replacement. by this time 7 days completed and according to the Amazon policy they only return and replace for 7 days. When spoke to Amazon customer care they just wouldn't connect me to the concern department they just bluntly say I should approach apple but apple executive tells me he can't do anything.

The final product received is having a dent and Amazon denied servicing and asked to check with Apple, Apple of-course denied since the product is purchased from third party e-commerce website.
Lesson learned after 5 days of total frustration and being played as shuttlecock between Amazon and Apple, its better to spend few bucks more and purchase iPhone from Apple rather than typing this review with a dented device.","45 people found this helpful"

I started facing battery issues after few days. Phone was charging from 0-100% in about half an hour and same with the discharge.
It went from 100 to 46% in 15 minutes and sometimes sudden shutdowns. I visited service centres and still my issues have not been resolved.
I tried amazon support to help me but nothing happened and still the device is not in well condition and I can't use it.
I had already checked that my product is genuine by filling all the details at apple website.
But something is wrong either from amazon or apple.

freezing to death all within 6 months and best part there is no after sales support either by Apple or Amazon.
Kind of service I have received from Apple, I think this is my first and last iPhone, second apple product and last.
It's better to get it from other platform or get it from store, Amazon does not provide any after sales support for iPhone 12.

Build quality was great as always from Apple.
Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I‚Äôm happy with the blue colour ‚Äú not bad at all and not too flashy‚Äù
Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient as a normal user.
If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.
There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it‚Äôs my personal opinion as a long time apple user)
As you all know iPhone 12 won‚Äôt comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)
I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900
I don‚Äôt judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.
I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.
A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.
Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I‚Äôm completely satisfied with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.
My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.
Thank you Apple India
Thank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.
Thank you Amazon India.

Most of them gets attracted to this phone even if they are not Iphone lovers due to size of this phone. In my view there is no other alternative for this iphone12 mini if u want any other features then you can go for iphone13mini. coming to pros it has stunning display, light weight ,amazing build quality and cons were the battery life is not so long it may take 5 hours to complete it ,camera is good but i am not that satisfied sometimes. Lastly i am the one who has taken this for the first time in my friends circle. I will rate is 3.5 out of 5",""
