Also doesn't mix well in hot milk. Never tried mixing using a shaker though. Also, I did a lot of calculations. This supplement offers one of the best protein/rupee ratio, much better than muscleblaze gold or massgainer pro and the likes. Of course, there is a limit to serving size so you can get only 12 g of protein at once. What I'm trying to say here is that it's cost-effective and bang for your buck\n",

I would recommend go for high protein content with no artificial sweeteners and low carbs. Any product of muscleblaze shows result with consistent hard work accompanied with good diet and rest(min 6-7 hours a day).I also recommend you to drink water as much as possible at least 4 litres a day while on protein intake. Drink protein powder in water not in milk. Milk contains caesin protein which is useful at night before bed. If Caesin mix whey protein l, it will take a lot of time to digest and again bloating and flatualence.Best time of protein shake- Anabolic State and/or Between the meals.All the best friends!\n",

BUT you need to research a little not for this product but yourself. just check your skin, if it is acne prone, don't buy it. It causes severe acne breakout. soon after taking this protein, I faced acne breakout on my face and back and on places where i never saw a pimple before. You can study online about this and choose a right brand and not this just because a shaker is free with it. thats what I did. I moved on to Myprotein. Although it is a bit expensive than this but I moved on from this product. I will write a review regarding my protein also after using it for a significant time.\n",

I got it fairly quick even in lockdown thanks to Amazon delivery service. I'd say it fulfilled its purpose. Since its a beginner product, it'll give you 12g of protein in one heaping scoop which is fairly enough for a beginner. It'll never miraculously help you in shedding weight as the product never intended to, its main purpose is to provide you protein which can be easily aborbed by your body after your workout session so that your muscles can heal up. Long story short its a good product to kickstart your healthly lifestyle. I've used it and I'm happy with it.\n",

      "So why is this protein very cheap as compared to other protein powders here is your answer yes the protein is cheap as it has lesser amount of protein % per scoop which is about 12g and plus 12g for carbohydrates as well comes with it other when protein has higher prices as they come with whipping amount of 26-30g of protein with 3.1g of carbohydrates...Now should we buy it is it worth it yes it is two scoops can give you 24g of protein and 24g of carbohydrates now now before you think isnt carbohydrates also there yes ut is but you can later reduce the carbohydrate intake from your diet to balance the calories.Now for the mixing it mixes well but only one scoop in 200ml water it doesn't have that heavy texture but 2 scoop will give you the perfect texturePricing yes 998 33servings it's a good dealLastly you cant label a protein powder good or bad just because you used it once at least 5-6 months you gotta use it in order to see the difference . And Getting a Good physique just doesnt come by consuming heavy expensive whey protein it takes time heavy lifting balanced diet and along with protein powder combination of all these can lead you to your fitness goal .I hope my review helps you in your fitness journey good luck\n",

When I open the jar it was only half fill. I thought that would be the quantity as I was buying for the first time but yesterday when I refill the jar with asitis whey I realised that someone has taken around 30-400 grams out and repack the jar from bottom.Even it was purchased from the reputed seller it's a altered.Amazon should look into these kind of issue. 1st time users can be cheated easily by sellers.\n",

      "At first, I was a bit skeptical about buying this protein powder because of a lot claims from people who have used it here in the review section. I saw people complaining about how they developed certain skin problems and allergies. But I decided to buy it anyways and try it for myself and I am glad that I did.I gained close to 4kg last time I checked my weight. I am seeing a noticeable difference in my muscle growth. And no, I didn't experience any sort of side effects or whatever. But you have to know that, protein powder can cause certain side effects to some people (I have read MB's blog). But the only way to know it is by trying it for yourself.The flavour is rich and it tastes sort of creamy. Gonna order another bottles soon. Totally recommended. 😊\n",

It was my first time buying supplements online and even when many people asked me to not buy it online even my fitness trainer even then I did, but Thanks to Amazon I received a full refund but it was still a disappointment to receive damage product after waiting for 5 days after placing the orderSo I'd recommend buy these things offline if you want to maintain a strict workout regime without any disturbance in day to day schedule a few hundred bucks are still worth to spend if you want your body to stay fit.But I've used this product earlier for like a year now so I'd say it's good for beginners just maintain a strict diet and buy it offline to reduce unwanted stress Amazon isn't a good choice for buying consumable or edible goods I'm saying this from past experiences too.\n",

      "Pros1. The flavor is good.2. The packaging is good.3. Mixability is good.4. It is okay for a price of Rs. 999.5. Funnily, it is enough sweet that you can use it as a substitute for adding sugar (if you have a habit of eating sugary food) because of its ingredients.Cons1. It contains Maltodextrin which has a very high GI, google and you would understand more, it is not a recommended ingredient if you have diabetes.2. The protein quantity per scoop is very less, so it might not be recommended if you have a little more experience or even for fast muscle recovery.3. Not recommended if you need insulin spike in your body.4. Not recommended for intermediate gym people.My verdict - It was good for a start but I am not gonna buy it again.If you really want Muscleblaze protein, go with MB Fuel one+.For students like me- If it is cheap, it doesn't mean it will be as effective, add 200 more and you can get unflavoured whey protein of MB which has higher protein content.\n",

Storage : Comes in an airtight jar4. Validity : You could easily check through the code given over the lid.5. Would easily last a month for 1 heap full scoop per day, depending on the usage.6. Taste : Everyone relates to this word “Chocolate”. Not bad at all.7. Certainly the best option out there for beginners and those seeking a budget friendly deal.8. Ideal Protein Content : Around 12 gms of protein is the safest bait for any beginner. Not more, no less.Cons1. Could cause digestion problems to lactose intolerant individuals and those with any history of stomach issues.2. If you’re not working out regularly, bloating is a possibility.3. A bit on the sweeter side. I like sweet, you may not though. Try adding more water or milk as per your taste.Note : Add water first and then the powder for ideal mixing and to avoid lumps.\n",

Also doesn't mix well in hot milk. Never tried mixing using a shaker though. Also, I did a lot of calculations. This supplement offers one of the best protein/rupee ratio, much better than muscleblaze gold or massgainer pro and the likes. Of course, there is a limit to serving size so you can get only 12 g of protein at once. What I'm trying to say here is that it's cost-effective and bang for your buck\n",

I would recommend go for high protein content with no artificial sweeteners and low carbs. Any product of muscleblaze shows result with consistent hard work accompanied with good diet and rest(min 6-7 hours a day).I also recommend you to drink water as much as possible at least 4 litres a day while on protein intake. Drink protein powder in water not in milk. Milk contains caesin protein which is useful at night before bed. If Caesin mix whey protein l, it will take a lot of time to digest and again bloating and flatualence.Best time of protein shake- Anabolic State and/or Between the meals.All the best friends!\n",

BUT you need to research a little not for this product but yourself. just check your skin, if it is acne prone, don't buy it. It causes severe acne breakout. soon after taking this protein, I faced acne breakout on my face and back and on places where i never saw a pimple before. You can study online about this and choose a right brand and not this just because a shaker is free with it. thats what I did. I moved on to Myprotein. Although it is a bit expensive than this but I moved on from this product. I will write a review regarding my protein also after using it for a significant time.\n",

I thought that would be the quantity as I was buying for the first time but yesterday when I refill the jar with asitis whey I realised that someone has taken around 30-400 grams out and repack the jar from bottom.Even it was purchased from the reputed seller it's a altered.Amazon should look into these kind of issue. 1st time users can be cheated easily by sellers.\n",

But I decided to buy it anyways and try it for myself and I am glad that I did.I gained close to 4kg last time I checked my weight. I am seeing a noticeable difference in my muscle growth. And no, I didn't experience any sort of side effects or whatever. But you have to know that, protein powder can cause certain side effects to some people (I have read MB's blog).

Funnily, it is enough sweet that you can use it as a substitute for adding sugar (if you have a habit of eating sugary food) because of its ingredients.Cons1. It contains Maltodextrin which has a very high GI, google and you would understand more, it is not a recommended ingredient if you have diabetes.2. The protein quantity per scoop is very less, so it might not be recommended if you have a little more experience or even for fast muscle recovery.3. Not recommended if you need insulin spike in your body.4. Not recommended for intermediate gym people.My verdict - It was good for a start but I am not gonna buy it again.If you really want Muscleblaze protein, go with MB Fuel one+.For students like me- If it is cheap, it doesn't mean it will be as effective, add 200 more and you can get unflavoured whey protein of MB which has higher protein content.\n",

Storage : Comes in an airtight jar4. Validity : You could easily check through the code given over the lid.5. Would easily last a month for 1 heap full scoop per day, depending on the usage.6. Taste : Everyone relates to this word “Chocolate”. Not bad at all.7. Certainly the best option out there for beginners and those seeking a budget friendly deal.8. Ideal Protein Content : Around 12 gms of protein is the safest bait for any beginner. Not more, no less.Cons1. Could cause digestion problems to lactose intolerant individuals and those with any history of stomach issues.2. If you’re not working out regularly, bloating is a possibility.3. A bit on the sweeter side. I like sweet, you may not though. Try adding more water or milk as per your taste.Note : Add water first and then the powder for ideal mixing and to avoid lumps.\n",

      "This product was my entry into the world of protein supplements and by far it has exceeded my expectations. This is made of whey concentrate which compared to the other forms like whey isolate has 80% protein only, but bear in mind unless you are a gym freak 80% protein is sufficient for you as this won't be the only meal you'll have all day. It has a mild sweet taste, which I personally prefer more than a strong sweetness. And if you are wondering about the taste, the chocolate flavour is pretty decent too and you can easily convince yourself it is a chocolate milkshake. It has the essential amino acids and BCAA with nothing that can be harmful for you. Although it is optimized for use with milk I recommend using it with water as whey is already a part of milk and adding milk makes it a thick and a bit slimy, also you can keep the nutritional value from the liquid part of the shake zero with water.The major down point being the amount of carbohydrates in it. Ideally in order to lose weight and make lean muscles carbohydrates should be avoided, unfortunately this should be termed a carb shake with 12 grams of protein but 12.5 grams of carbs per 30g serving.Inside the packet there is a verification code to see if the product is genuine and also a 30g scoop within the powder.On a budget, this is a decent product but not a value for money.\n",

      "Whey protein is commonly used for improving athletic performance and increasing strength, but evidence to support these uses is mixed. Whey protein is also used to reverse weight loss in people with HIV and to help prevent allergic conditions in infants. Whey protein is a source of protein that might improve the nutrient content of the diet. Whey protein might also have effects on the immune system.This is a very high-quality Beginners WHEY protein. Beginners whey protein means it does not have a high amount of protein, which really good for beginners. Actually, protein consumption depends on your body habit, so if you are not habituated then there may be a problem occur to digest the whey protein. I joined the gym two months ago. That's why I brought this protein. It helps me to maintain the protein balance of my body. I just love its double chocolate flavor.--This Whey Protein is Gluten Free.--This Whey Protein Banned Substance Free.--There is a 33gm Scoop inside the container also.--It is fast-acting whey protein. Imported from the USA.--It is ultra-filtered Whey for less cholesterol, fat & sodium.--It contains Digestive Enzymes for faster absorption.--It can be mix easily using glass and spoon.--It is manufactured in an ISO certified company.--It provides 12gm Protein, 12.5gm carbohydrate, 0.95gm Fat, and 104KCAL in per scoop serving.It has 90% Isolated Whey Protein, Cocoa bean extract, Sodium Chloride, Xanthum gum (INS 415).  The presence of these ingredients is really a good sign of a good quality protein powder. It provides energy and enhanced body performance. It helps to recover fastly from tiredness also.It also has Digestive Enzymes like- Lactase, Papain & Bromelain. These Digestive Enzymes help to digest this protein very fast.This whey protein is instantized. That means if there is no shaker cup or any blender, just add one rounded scoop of this Whey protein to a glass filled with 6-7oz (200 ml approx) of water, low-fat milk, or any favorite beverage. Then mix it up with a spoon, stir it until the powder is completely dissolved.This Whey Protein can be used for more than just protein shakes. By adding fresh or frozen fruits, peanut butter, flaxseed oil, coconut, and other high-energy ingredients, can transform the shake into a delicious high-protein meal.It also can be consumed by mixing a scoop of it with oatmeal, yogurt.Take 1-2 servings a day or as suggested by the dietician. I take this Whey protein twice a day. I take it with water at the time of breakfast and in the evening after the Gym.--Please use this before 18months of manufacture.--Net Weight is 1KG.\n",

It was a insect and a plastic material you can see all the pics I already attached.This is pathetic and very injurious to our health.Then I call firstly Muscleblaze ( they are just taking advantage on the tag of being Indian brand ).Call not connected. Then I email my issue and call again next day.MB customer consultant disconnect my call they are saying this is my fault ( Saying why this happened after long time ).( Where you kept the protein jar )( Why this happened in the bottom of jar if there is insect it comes just after opening )and some more silly replyTrust me they are not even apologize for their mistake.I am really disappointed from this.I will never gonna use MUSCLEBLAZE product I swear.I hope all the buyers think many times before using this cheap brand.\n",
