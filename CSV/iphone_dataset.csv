But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there’s a glitch in the front camera’s portrait mode. That’s fine, it may happen. But what’s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!",1.0 out of 5 stars

22,63 people found this helpful,Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. It’s heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Don’t watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes it’s expensive.

30,35 people found this helpful,This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down.,3.0 out of 5 stars

32,32 people found this helpful,All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules,5.0 out of 5 stars

43,14 people found this helpful,"This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market.",1.0 out of 5 stars

46,15 people found this helpful,"Like every time, Apple has again mesmerised me with it’s great creation iPhone XR. The best part in this is when you unbox your brand new iPhone. It comes with an earpod, and a Fast charger. I understand that the price might be a bit high but trust me, it’s worth it. The camera has the best feature within it. Everyone says that it’s an LCD screen but you’ll nit be able to differentiate just by looking at the screen. The phone performance  is more faster now. And last but not the least, I am really impressed with the battery back up time. It really lasts. Full charge at 10 am and then the whole day on Cellular Data, I have played PES2019, played some songs from YouTube Music, hovering on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook and clicked some good photos. When i came back home at 11 o’clock, i still had 66% charge. That’s what we needed in an iPhone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

70,4 people found this helpful,I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. There’s a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phone’s working completely fine though.  So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe it’s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didn’t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still don’t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. It’s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didn’t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.,2.0 out of 5 stars

82,5 people found this helpful,Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You won’t find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you won’t spot any difference with other iPhone displays.

85,2 people found this helpful,"Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update.",5.0 out of 5 stars

108,One person found this helpful,"I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus.  After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, I’m feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So it’s a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory.",4.0 out of 5 stars

218,0,"This is my third iPhone and I must say - each time Apple introduces an iPhone, they improve a lot in each model. iPhone XR is one of best selling iPhone for year 2018. Its not that cheap but still standout in crowd. Its not expensive than iPhone XS but still have all the features same as other top models- only difference is OLED screen but I can live with that. Recently introduced iPhone 11 and XR have only one difference which is of Price. Most of the features are exactly same. Best Battery backup ever in an iPhone I must say. Soothing and flawless iOS.  Camera is more than average and very much improved as compared to previous generations. Glass frame back and front and very appealing to eyes. Overall, a satisfactory experience with this device.

I was confused between One plus 7 Pro, IPhone XS and the XR and I must admit that it turned out to be a good decision. Its a classy product and feels premium in hand compared to other devices in this price range. The features that the other phones boast about are hardly being used in day to day life unless you are an avid gamer. The screen size is just perfect and quality is not bad as being highlighted in some of the reviews on youtube. Battery life is excellent, camera is very good and the phone is waterproof.

These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you won’t even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it can’t click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits).",5.0 out of 5 stars

309,0,It is my red beast.... My first iPhone experience with iPhone xr is very smooth and awesome... I got is at only 38K many many thanks to amazon for this. Battery performance is good... with normal usage it gives around 24hrs backup while with heavy usage 12-13 hrs backup u can definitely get. But charging adapter  in the box is very pathetic. I just ordered an 12W fast charger at 1K from amazon. It is a smart choice to get iPhone Xr at 40K over iPhone 11 at 59 K (Including HDFC bank offer). With your saved money u can buy different apple accessories. Overall my first iPhone experience is awesome.,5.0 out of 5 stars

1,122 people found this helpful,"SUMMERY: As a first time iPhone user, I would say one should definitely buy iPhone ONLY for premium built & premium hardware (will talk later) while the whole iOS experience is pretty overrated. iPhones isn't any exceptionally fast with normal apps like YouTube, Insta etc, Android phones are equally snappy with them in 2022.
PROS:
1. Impressive hardware, the heptics, the autobrightness & otherwise highly ignored things in Android are way too perfectly executed in iPhone and it DOES make a big difference in user experience!!
2. The screen is AMAZING.. it doesn't have 90 or 120 hz refresh rate but it FEELS better than my Nord with 90 hz!!
3. A14 bionic promises years of performance ahead.
4. Battery life is somewhere in between good & great.
5.
6. The dimensions of phone, it's smaller than usual android phones and feels much more handy along with less weight.
7. Overall build quality is great.
8. Best audio output out there.
9. Long term support.
CONS:
1. SLOW CHARGING. 20 W only, you'll be jealous of 1/3rd price phones with 60 W charging. Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery's health.
2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there's still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many ""commonsense"" things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????
3. DON'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.
4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that's missing.
5. Ridiculously expensive accessories
6. Battery life is above good but not great.
In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it's expensive. Do know that you're NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2,74 people found this helpful,"I purchased this phone for my wife. Last year I purchased iPhone X for my son who is currently in the UK. I own an iPad and iMac 27"". I am not going to buy an iPhone for myself - at least not yet. One of the main things that I don't like about Android phones is the crap (bloatware) that each maker puts in. Moto and Google Pixel come with pure stock Android. So those can be left out. So I wanted a good phone for my wife so that she could FaceTime with my son in the UK anytime.
What is there to say? So many have written about it. Since everyone writes all the positives, I will write some negatives. While there aren't too many, no product can be perfect:
1. Brings in all the junk from the old phone. If one is switching from Android to iPhone, the ""Move to iOS"" app on Android can help. However be sure to clean up your Android phone first else all junk (especially ""Good Morning"", ""Good day"" picture crap from WhatsApp photos). Be sure to clean the SMS inbox also, especially all those blocked and spam messages which may be hidden from the main view and we never know that exist.
2. WhatsApp cannot be synced. Yes, there are 3rd party apps but they are full of ad-crap and I can't trust them for security.
3. Difficulty in validating iMessage and FaceTime. I could not activate iMessage and FaceTime with my mobile number. I simply could not figure this out. This is the case with my Vodaphone SIM/Number in India. Only when I added my email to my Apple ID, the two apps started working. Even now, the mobile number is not verified.
4. I wish Apple provides dual SIM. Now dual SIM is almost a necessity. But as my wife does not use two SIMs, for her, it is fine.
5. Apple is providing USB-C to lightning cable. They should supply USB-A to lightning cable instead. 99% of the chargers have a USB-A output. I had to purchase a USB-A to USB-C mini adapter (?180) for this, or someone may have to buy a cable of the type (good cables from Apple, Belkin, Anker cost ?1100 and above). By far, this is my biggest grouse.
6. This is not the latest iPhone. The iPhone 13 was ?73,000 and did not seem VFM. Even at ?56,000 (?55,900 to be exact), the iPhone12 may not be money best spent. This is one reason, why I haven't purchased an iPhone for myself all this while (I can afford to buy the latest one every year).",4.0 out of 5 stars

9. Long term support.
CONS:
1. SLOW CHARGING. 20 W only, you'll be jealous of 1/3rd price phones with 60 W charging. Yes that much high charging will effect health of battery but 20 W is way way too less, if Apple is such a legendary company they should have created a battery that can withstand decently fast charging while instead they just use slow charging to keep their battery's health.
2. Overy exhagerated software experience, reality is that Android is more user friendly with better gesture & commonsense options & settings & steps to do simple things. iOS looks pretty yes but UX engineers at Apple have really done a crappy job.. there's still no notification grouping in correct manner (its executed poorly), no proper homescreen customisation & just so so so many ""commonsense"" things are missing from iOS I can rant all day about it. Everything you can do in Android with a single click or swipe takes 2 swipes and then a click to do in iOS its SOOOOO ANNOYING. Like you want to clear a notification? Swipe and then click on clear. You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????
3. DON'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.
4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that's missing.
5. Ridiculously expensive accessories
6. Battery life is above good but not great.
In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it's expensive. Do know that you're NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty.",4.0 out of 5 stars
22,74 people found this helpful,"I purchased this phone for my wife. Last year I purchased iPhone X for my son who is currently in the UK. I own an iPad and iMac 27"". I am not going to buy an iPhone for myself - at least not yet. One of the main things that I don't like about Android phones is the crap (bloatware) that each maker puts in. Moto and Google Pixel come with pure stock Android. So those can be left out. So I wanted a good phone for my wife so that she could FaceTime with my son in the UK anytime.
What is there to say? So many have written about it. Since everyone writes all the positives, I will write some negatives. While there aren't too many, no product can be perfect:
1. Brings in all the junk from the old phone. If one is switching from Android to iPhone, the ""Move to iOS"" app on Android can help. However be sure to clean up your Android phone first else all junk (especially ""Good Morning"", ""Good day"" picture crap from WhatsApp photos). Be sure to clean the SMS inbox also, especially all those blocked and spam messages which may be hidden from the main view and we never know that exist.
2. WhatsApp cannot be synced. Yes, there are 3rd party apps but they are full of ad-crap and I can't trust them for security.
3. Difficulty in validating iMessage and FaceTime. I could not activate iMessage and FaceTime with my mobile number. I simply could not figure this out. This is the case with my Vodaphone SIM/Number in India. Only when I added my email to my Apple ID, the two apps started working. Even now, the mobile number is not verified.
4. I wish Apple provides dual SIM. Now dual SIM is almost a necessity. But as my wife does not use two SIMs, for her, it is fine.
5. Apple is providing USB-C to lightning cable. They should supply USB-A to lightning cable instead. 99% of the chargers have a USB-A output. I had to purchase a USB-A to USB-C mini adapter (?180) for this, or someone may have to buy a cable of the type (good cables from Apple, Belkin, Anker cost ?1100 and above). By far, this is my biggest grouse.
6. This is not the latest iPhone. The iPhone 13 was ?73,000 and did not seem VFM. Even at ?56,000 (?55,900 to be exact), the iPhone12 may not be money best spent. This is one reason, why I haven't purchased an iPhone for myself all this while (I can afford to buy the latest one every year).",4.0 out of 5 stars

The real problem started while using it,
The Phone started to overheat for minimal usages, I'd call for 5 to 10 minutes hands would be burning with phone heat, 15 minutes of social media again hands would be burning hot, I didn't get any temperature warning but heat was hot enuf for me to keep it aside for a long period of time, Due to overheat the battery used to die fast and I would hv required to charge it thrice a day. I roamed around the Apple authorized service centres and so many calls to Amazon for a replacement but nobody seems to give me any solution, then I thought I'll just use it, but again it started getting worse and I called Apple and they said to give my phone to service centre for 7 to 10 days so they can diagnosis be done and find out issue while I survive 7 to 10 days without a phone haha, then I couldn't take it anymore as I understood if I continue using this phone I wouldn't get 4 weeks yet alone 4 years and pleaded to Amazon coz I am a prime member ever since prime was out and I have ordered tons and tons of products in Amazon and never faced this issue.
But the hard earned money going like this was hurting so I submitted whatever documents Amazon asked me to get from Apple and finally they gave me return for this product.
The item has been returned and get to reach their warehouse which then oly I will get my refund initiated which is gonna take another 15 to 20 days, but I'm fine since I can wait and not lose my hard earned money. For now I hv a 7 year old phone as backup which is working ok ok but I can manage to write atleast this review.
So whoever face this issue, and wants a replacement or return please try your best with whatever Amazon asks from you n they will provide a solution.
I still need to buy an Apple phone next coz I bought the 2k adapter and it's return period got over haha.
Anyways the Phone was amazing to use,
So performance wise 5/5
Camera was just amazing 5/5
Battery tho 1 or 2/5
Over heating so -2/5 or 0/5
Overall a bad experience but still excited to get apple product.
Btw Apple service centres help very well and listen to ur problems and provide solutions properly and handles it well.
So if you are getting a iPhone I hope u guys don't face any situation like mine.
Thank you n have a great day :)",3.0 out of 5 stars
42,97 people found this helpful,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I’ve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive.
If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.
Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021), apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra. If you read a few reviews you’ll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues and 9pro cameras didn’t live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.
Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:
1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)
2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag
3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality
4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand
5. The haptics are spot on
What’s Missing: (Minor misses though)
1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you’ll get used to it.
2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change
3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensor
Wait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:
It took a while for 12’s prices to fall. If you’re willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.
64GB or 128GB:
The difference is around ?6000. 64GB if you don’t play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128?
Battery:
I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to it’s competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.
Android Flagship Option:
The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.
Hope this review helped :)
Update:
13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That’s it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.
iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12’s launch price(86k). If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k). However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.
Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022.",5.0 out of 5 stars

60,220 people found this helpful,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.
Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)
Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items. But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?
Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.
I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.

Battery backup is really good 2800 mAh in apple is almost like 5000mAh in android am not kidding, i have rog phone 3 it is 6000 mAh but at the end of the day the i phone has almost same % left, may be it's due to the less hz display.
Despite of having 60Hz display it feels good
And what can i say the speakers are loud and clear compared with rog 3.
45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it's not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.
No charger is a big let down by apple. And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.
No Finger print sensor , but it's ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good. And for the notch it's ok.

I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-
Memory
Build quality
Camera
Processor
Display
Except battery there’s rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,
iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here’s some condition that you should aware about
1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.
2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you’re on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.
Here’s some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know “How to save battery on iPhone 12” this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.
For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don’t have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.

Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.
It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-
iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.
let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-
1. Notifications
- You can't reply through notifications.
- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)
- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).
- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.
2. App library
- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.
3. whatsapp
- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.
- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.
- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)
- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.
The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.
I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.
I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.
Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.
I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.
And boy was I surprised . Let’s take up the review in sections.
1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .
2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it’s only for social media and you are not printing really big.
3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it’s average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.
4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.
5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.
Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I was very much confused between iphone 11 and this one as the price of iphone dropped ... But i am glad i chose this over iphone 11.
1.Display:
Main upgrade in iphone 12 is the oled display. Boy o boy the screen is amazing. I have user many android flagship's but this beats them all.
2.Battery:
Battery is amazing. I am getting 1.5 days of battery life with my usage.
PS: i dont play games.
3.IOS:
This is my 1st iphone and the experience with ios is great ... Very smooth animations ..even though its not 90hz screen but everything is buttery smooth.
4. Camera:
The pics from this phone is superb. FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA! You will not be dissapointed.
5 Build &Design :
This phone looks and feels very premium compared to other phones.Very comfotable to use.
6.Face Id:
Face id works very fast and accurate in low lighting conditions.
7.Updates:
Ios14 is good and we can expect another 4yrs of software updates thats huge !
Cons:
1.Priced very high but it may be because of high taxes and custom duty.
2.No charger and earpods in the box.
3.Notifications are a mess ...android is better in managing new notifications.

- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.
- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume and gives awesome vibe while listening to music
- iOS has no bugs at all
- 20W charging is lit ?
- The Face ID feels like having no lock for yourself, there’s no issue while using Face ID even in the dark because it uses infrared rays to scan the face

178,141 people found this helpful,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ? 84900. After credit card discount(?6000), old phone exchange(?3450) and reward points money(?4530) inclusion, I bought it for ?70920. There’s also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn’t let go of blue
1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it’d cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn’t seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.
2: DISPLAY: I’ve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.
3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.
How to choose between 64/128gb:
If you’re not really tight on budget, I’d suggest to go for 128gb variant. I’ve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage occupied about 60gb. So it’d make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.
CONS:
1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price
2. If you’re an android user, migration would be little time consuming

2) Some advertised features require the support of additional devices of Apple Eco System. For example, Apple said with iOS 15.3 face ID will work even with Masks On. But I just learned that this feature works only if you have an iWatch also.
3) Not a gamer, but still for this price point at least a 90Hz refresh was desirable.

Pro Apple
1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.
And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud.
2. Battery
The battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.
3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.
4. Build Quality - SOLID.
5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.
6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.
Pro Android / Anti - iOS
1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.
2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.
3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.
4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.
5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.
6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.
7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.

I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.
The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.
The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.
The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.
Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.
Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

If u are looking for overall beast for moderate to heavy usage go for it without any hesitation. I think price dropped more in future beacause now chip will be made in indian apple factory. I you not use iphone before purchase it then u will see the power of iphone. Only thing u will disappointed with the battery. It will last only 5-6 hrs of moderate use.

221,,"Well they are a multinational conglomerate and I have simply purchased a product of theirs, so I shouldn’t be commenting on their product launching strategy. However keeping this aside, I would try to genuinely help those looking for reviews before buying, in a few simple steps.
1. Go for it if you are going for an upgrade after 3-4 years, as it will give you some flawless experience again.
2. Battery life is not upto the mark, I feel XR that I used before this had a good battery, maybe I am wrong.
3. Face ID has got no significant improvement at all, again I think XR had a better face detection.

228,46 people found this helpful,"From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.
As per the limitations :
1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)
2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.
3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)
4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)
5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)
Advantages:
1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.
2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)
3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)
4. The design and in-hand feel.
5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.
Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)
On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.
But iPhone 12 in 2020? its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.
If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars

241,38 people found this helpful,"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.
All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.
The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.
So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily.",5.0 out of 5 stars

251,3 people found this helpful,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.
As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.
Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.
When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.
I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.
INR 3000? Discount on the colour white, plus 6000? HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000?. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900? more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.

Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.
For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.

I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.
And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again. FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.
SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?
THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in android
and lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.

Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.
I’ll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.
Pros:
1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.
2. The speed, the performance.
3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don’t usually need any professional touch.
4. Battery life - I’ll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don’t play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don’t believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.
Cons
Nothing much until now.
The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.
Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box.",5.0 out of 5 stars

373,9 people found this helpful,"I have been an apple user for the past 10 years and this is the first phone which is disappointing. I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.
1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.
2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR
3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.
4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.
5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.
6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.
7. again no ear phones.
8. It somehow doesn't have the wow factor as what the X had.
Update.
I exchange my phone for a 12 mini. much more easier to use with one hand and comfortable.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I also really like it's ram working since my app in background keeps running without always reloading it when again opened.
One last since I haven't used 120 Hz refresh rate so I can’t tell about it but since my old phone was also no having it so for me it's awesome?.

Let’s look at the some of key pointers here what I saw -
- Stunning design and spectacular OLed display pouring out all the vivid colors
- Smooth app flow and transitions
- Longer battery life 7-8 hrs without automation (best in my usage)
- Camera is just bringing the life out of all the captures you make.
*I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It’s almost a month of usage and I can boldly say, “The best switch one can make”. I know the price tag is always hefty but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.
*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.
*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Pros:
1. The green colour is gorgeous

4. Screen is very bright and has vibrant colours
5. Speaker is very loud

2. Indian variant doesn't have the mmWave antenna, inspite of being more expensive than the US Variant

I have more to add to my earlier review after roughly a month of use. The phone is an original Apple device. It's smooth and quick, and it doesn't become hot when in use or charging. The charge lasts the entire day (I use it mostly for social media, web browsing and music) Face recognition is excellent. Battery health is 100% (check this when you receive your phone under ‘battery health' in settings) and to keep it that way, make sure you close all background apps while the phone is not in use. Play a ‘pixel test 4K' video on YouTube to see if your phone monitor has any dead pixels. I use the original Apple adaptor (which must be purchased separately) and the type C cable that comes in the box. Overall the phone is a great purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Notifications are a hassle, it keeps coming up
Either you can stop them completely or you keep them coming, there is no middle ground
Battery backup is average and also isnt properly optimised

One problem I encountered is that the battery life is not great but definitely above average. Another issue is the notch which makes the phone look outdated especially in 2021. The Face ID is also not useful while wearing masks which causes a lot of inconvenience since the phone doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner.

Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs.

WiFi in beginning had trouble connecting sometimes.
Pros:
No bloatware
Great security, even installing a new app or system update requires face I'd or pin.
Good for special needs people they get lot of tools to help usage like voice control, which is others can use to coz its handy.

722,6 people found this helpful,"I was an Android user and had high hopes with this Apple gadget, however after 8 months of using this so hyped Apple device, I can finally say that an iPhone is similar to a Shadi ka ladoo — jo Khaaye wo pachtaaye aur jo na khaye wo bhi pachtaaye. The reason I am saying this is because this phone lacks even the most basic features that even a 5k android phone has, like - call recording - which I eventually realised that it should have been an Apple feature instead of third party apps - which demand money and are pretty inconvenient to use.
The second drawback is that call logs are auto erased and kept up to a certain stack size (100 / 102) and if you want to go back to pull any earlier call logs beyond this specified stack size, you won’t be able to do so and will have to rely on your network provider (if you are eligible) for the same.
These are two very ground level use cases that fail to deliver in an Apple device and since I faced real life situations surrounding these two scenarios I feel that I it is not worth having this Phone and better to keep your “Android” pants on.
Then I thought why I bought this phone in the first place and got my answer -
1. Camera ??
Android phones are easily competing nicely with iPhone Camera now-a-days and some have even better camera.
2. Brand marketing / re-selling value / durability ??
I am so over it now after 8 months of usage and the price keeps on sinking down as newer model enters the market so not a wise call I must say

Definitely not a returning customer.",1.0 out of 5 stars

And then they informed that a small percent of iphone 12 manufactured between October 2020 and April 2021 are having sound issues and Apple has a free service for those iphones at their authorised service centers. So now the phone is unable to take videos or even play videos on all apps related to sound including videos taken earlier by the phone. None of the sound notifications are working.

Usual iPhone perks- longer software support.
Dislikes:
Overpriced as usual, more so this time since not bundled with earphones and charger.
Apple charger doesn't come with a lightning cable. Please buy cable separately, if needed.
The selfie camera dulls the skin tone. Selfies taken via Androids look better.

Called Amazon support as it was within replacement period, they asked for a service denial report from apple service centre. When I checked with the service centre they informed apple never shares a service denial letter . And by my logic it was reasonable as how can apple deny service for their own product under warranty. Anyways amazon was useless , no support provided stating some strange reasons (service denial letter) !!
Took this to apple service centre (iplanet vr mall bangalore) they kept my phone for 14 days doing nothing. They confirmed the phone is defective at the first place but was not able to support as it is a software glitch. They want me to escalate it through apple support only. Irony is I submitted it in service centre as per the suggestion by apple online support.

1019,673 people found this helpful,"Extremely disappointed with this phone. It’s a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple’s trickery and gimmickry.
The battery doesn’t last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won’t be enough for anyone.
And then there are other apple quirks - won’t come with a SD card, won’t come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won’t work with this one. Face ID won’t work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you’re out and vulnerable. This phone won’t allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn’t use. You won’t be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won’t let you.
Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn’t cost you more than 12 to 14K.
Apple is going down!
Amazon won’t take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy. So I am pretty much stuck with this damn excuse for a phone till I get to upgrade to a Samsung phone.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Quite absurd! I quote below the etracts of their email dated 25th Aug 2021... Quote: I've reviewed your concern and see that our customer service team was able to address your issue concerning your exchange being denied. We are unable to provide internal information about the reason for exchanges being denied. Unquote:
Now that's a complete surprise to a customer... If my phone doesn't gets exchanged, as customers I need to know the reasons too.. denial by Amazon to give a reason implies here that the exchange options are a gimmick to lure in customers to buy Phones on their online store..

But even after updating there was no improvement so called apple support spoke to then at length about my situation and after hearing me they did some troubleshooting and came to a conclusion that it has some hardware problem and should approach Amazon as they were responsible for selling me this product for replacement. by this time 7 days completed and according to the Amazon policy they only return and replace for 7 days. When spoke to Amazon customer care they just wouldn't connect me to the concern department they just bluntly say I should approach apple but apple executive tells me he can't do anything.

1892,"1,244 people found this helpful","Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.
Build quality was great as always from Apple.
Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I’m happy with the blue colour “ not bad at all and not too flashy”
Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient as a normal user.
If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.
There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it’s my personal opinion as a long time apple user)
As you all know iPhone 12 won’t comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)
I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900
I don’t judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.
I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.
A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.
Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I’m completely satisfied with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.
My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.
Thank you Apple India
Thank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.
Thank you Amazon India.

In my view there is no other alternative for this iphone12 mini if u want any other features then you can go for iphone13mini. coming to pros it has stunning display, light weight ,amazing build quality and cons were the battery life is not so long it may take 5 hours to complete it ,camera is good but i am not that satisfied sometimes. Lastly i am the one who has taken this for the first time in my friends circle. I will rate is 3.5 out of 5",4.0 out of 5 stars
