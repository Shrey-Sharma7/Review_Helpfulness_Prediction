"Jitin","4.0 out of 5 stars","Magnetism is not how you test the chemical composition of steel!","This is a good steel bottle, and a good alternative to plastic bottles. The body of the bottle is made of a rather thin sheet of metal and the build could have been sturdier. The body as well as the lid are made of steel. The lid seems to have some plastic on the insIde, I would have preferred it to be all steel with silicone. The lid in particular is important in a bottle as there are studies which show that bottles with plastic lids can lead to small particles of plastic brushing down the bottle when you open and close the lid.
The package and the website mention the steel to be 18/8 composition. A few reviewers have noted that the bottle is magnetic. It is a myth that 18/8 steel cannot be magnetic when in fact it is very common for 18/8 steel to become magnetic on cold working. Magnetism is not the proper way to test for steel composition. Somehow I doubt that a company like Milton would make a false claim in this regard (as they can be sued, right?). Someone should get the bottle tested for its material composition and the presence of harmful elements like lead.
Iron as it exists in nature exhibits magnetic properties. However in some forms of steel, the iron atoms are arranged in such an alternating way that they cancel out each other's magnetism. Hence the net magnetism turns out to be zero. 18-8 is one such steel which is normally non-magnetic. However, when you cold work this type of steel (physically deform it in some way, bend it, etc.) the structure partially changes to a different one where the iron atoms are not located so as to be able to completely cancel out each other's magnetism, leading to partial magnetism in the steel. This is probably what is happening with this bottle. The chemical composition however remains the same since you or only changing the physical structure, so the steel is still 18-8 but has become partially magnetic. Unless the magnetism poses a problem, this is not an issue (why should it be?). Technically speaking, 18-8 is an austenitic steel which is non-magnetic, but on cold working some of it transforms to martensitic steel which is magnetic.
Will all 18-8 steels become magnetic on cold forming? No, the process partially depends on the amount of carbon in the steel. Steels with lower carbon content would probably not get magnetised as much. The magnetism can also be removed after the cold work by heating the steel to a fairly high temperature to remove the internal stresses and bring the stucture back to austenitic where the iron atoms cancel out each others' magnetism.
I have bottles from the US - from a brand called Klean Kanteen which is fairly well-reputed, and unsurprisingly they are magnetic too while claiming to be 18-8 or 304 steel. The reason being the same - cold working makes 18-8 steel partially magnetic.","264 people found this helpful"

"Shatovisha","4.0 out of 5 stars","Received a used product","Because it's Milton, the product is good, but it seemed like the one I received was a one some other person has used or had returned earlier. There were marks of dried water droplets outside the bottle’s body, and it had water inside the bottle also. The cap is good, and although haven't tested it, should be most probably leak proof.
Also, the bottle was bare bodied inside the Milton packaging, and the plastic cover was just crushed and at the bottom.
This delivery took a week to just dispatch even when the manufacturer was of Gurgaon and the delivery location was of Delhi, and I had bought this as a gift, so couldn't wait any longer to file for replacement. So, I will be going ahead with this one, but a little disappointing experience, tbh.","One person found this helpful"

"Shashank","4.0 out of 5 stars","good product. Unisteel is different from Thermosteel","● Built quality = I have used 6 to 7 steel bottle trust me it's a good quality . Bottle is strong.
● leak = no leakage at all
● concern about logo = don't worry about the logo of Milton. Logo without a ring around the O of miltOn is official too. Even on the official website of Milton many products have Milton name on it without any ring around O. i.e. only Milton has been printed on bottle.
◆Concern = only concern I have that its cap contain plastic covering inside which I think will get separate from its metal part in future.
Otherwise this bottle is very good product at 345 price
◆◆◆ plz remember unisteel is not a thermos. Its a single layer steel. So don't expect that when you will take bottle out of freeze, it will keep water cool as it is for 5-6 hrs.
It is not a thermos. If you want thermos go for Thermosteel.","14 people found this helpful"

"Kamal Gola","5.0 out of 5 stars","Comparison with Solimo 1000 ml","Milton has been the uncrowned king for water bottles in India. Solimo's curved shape makes it fix tightly in backpack side-pockets while Milton's slim design makes it easy to pull. Solimo's inflated rings provide a good grip but then it can only be deep cleaned better with a brush. Whereas Milton plain surface makes it easy to clean. It is truly a fridge water bottle with 950 ml capacity while Solimo is 1 liter. Both are tall and a bit heavy to carry in a backpack side-pocket as the bag will drag to that side. Both are a bit slim for a cup holder in cars. The plastic casing inside the caps makes both leak proof.","2 people found this helpful"

I could see that magnet was attaching to the bottle.Although this doesn't seems to concern, but need to check on the long run.

Two suggestions.
1. For user; do not over tight the cap. The SS cap is loosely fitted. May come off when opening next.
2. For manufacturer; the total weight of a filled bottle may cause dent at the bottom.
A suitable ring to fit at the outer bottom would prevent it, when kept on hard surfaces like kitchen slabs.","One person found this helpful"

"ks","1.0 out of 5 stars","Milton, I am so disappointed in you. Quality of bottles reduced since 2019","I had brought a couple of these bottles two years ago (in 2019). And I had liked them, so I reordered recently. But I was taken aback because the new bottles were light in weight and the finish of the cap wasnt like the older bottles I have. Also, someone mentioned a magnet test and indeed a magnet would stick to these new bottles. This didnt happen for older bottles. I thought may be I was sent a fake product. The seller was some company I didnt recognize.
So I returned the new bottles and placed an order again; this time with the seller as Cloudtail. But got the same result. So I am returning these too.
It seems Milton has reduced the quality of its product. I did not expect this from an older trusted company and brand name. Its such a shame and disappointment. I'd rather go to a local market and buy a better quality bottle. I am giving a one star for breach of trust.","One person found this helpful"

1 - In less than a month since this bottle was purchased, it has started developing rust.
Why would anyone pay a premium for a brand name and in return get a bottle which doesn't even hold durable for 1 month!!!
Milton is no longer what it used to be earlier.
